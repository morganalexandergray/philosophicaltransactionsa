TASK
In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.

-START INSTRUCTIONS-
YOU will assess sentences to and determine whether they belong to any of the following categories based on the content of the sentence and the descriptions below: 

1. Furtive Movement - Use this label if the driver or passenger in the vehicle makes a suspicious movement, such as reaching beneath a seat, or in a purse or bag, or around a waistband, or in a pocket, which is commonly an attempt to conceal contraband or a weapon.  This also includes attempting to evade custody such as taking a long time to pull the vehicle over.  Simple driving mistakes do not count under this factor.
2. Nervous Behavior or Appearance - Use this label if the motorist appears to be nervous, has shaking hands or a heavy heartbeat, or is sweating even though the temperature is cool.  Also use this label if the the motorist behaves in a nervous way, avoids making eye contact with the officer, focuses on a bag or compartment in the car, appears to be agitated, confronts the officer, gives the officer a curt response, volunteers too much information, or behaves in an overly friendly way toward the officer. 
3. Suspicious or Inconsistent Answers - Use this label if the driver made an answer to an officer that is evasive, nonsensical, inconsistent, contradictory, impossible, vague, incomplete, unusual, or untruthful.
4. Motorist license or Identification - Use this label if the motorist cannot provide the officer with a license or identification or if the license is invalid, revoked, fake, the wrong color, flimsy, or in someone else’s name. 
5. Driver Status - Use this label only if the driver of the vehicle is male, young, or not from the state in which the officer pulled the car over. 
6. Refused Consent - Use this label if the driver refused to consent to the officer’s request to search the automobile.
7. Legal Indications of Drug Use - Use this label if the motorist has an active arrest warrant for a drug related charge or if the motorist has been arrested for or convicted of a drug related offense in the past or if the officer knows that the motorist has abused, possessed, dealed, or trafficked in drugs in the past. 
8. Motorist's Appearance Related to Drug Use or Sale - Use this label if driver looks like they USE DRUGS such as needle track marks, rotten teeth, scabbing, bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils, unwashed hair, dirty clothes, body odor or dirty skin or if the driver is wearing suspicious clothing, such as expensive jewelry, expensive or luxury clothing, or clothing with images of drugs (e.g., marijuana leaves).
9. Possible Drug Route - Use this label if the driver’s route is from or to a city or area, which is known for drug trafficking or high crime rates, or if the driver stops the vehicle late at night or early in the morning in an area known for criminal activity. 
10. Unusual Travel Plans - Use this label if the motorist appears to be headed to a location that the motorist has already passed, is traveling on a road that does not lead to the stated destination, plans a trip that is too far to drive in a reasonable time (e.g., driving from Philadelphia to Miami in a single night), claims to be driving a long round trip in a one-day rental vehicle, or has other unusual travel plans.
11. Expensive Vehicle - Use this label if the motorist is driving a kind of vehicle associated with illicit drug use or trafficking such as a luxury or expensive vehicle, e.g., a BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, or Range Rover.
12. Vehicle License Plate or Registration - Use this label if the vehicle's license plate is missing, shielded from view, or from out of state, or if the license plate or vehicle registration has expired.
13. Unusual Vehicle Ownership - Use this label if the vehicle is rented or if the vehicle is owned by someone not in the vehicle, unknown to the driver, or about whom the driver knows very little or claims to be a distant relative. 
14. Indicia of Hard Travel - Use this label if the motorist has been driving a great distance for a long time and is attempting to make as few stops as possible, or if the vehicle contained fast-food bags, lots of trash, energy drinks or substances designed to keep the consumer awake, such as Redbull, Five-Hour Energy, or Energize Capsules. 
15. Masking Agent - Use this label if the vehicle contained a substance or product used to mask the odor of drugs such as air fresheners (e.g., Little Trees, Febreze, Glade, etc.), scented dryer sheets or baby wipes, or strongly smelling tobacco products, cigars or cigarettes or other strong smells.
16. Vehicle Contents Suggest Drugs - This label SHOULD NOT be used for anything found after a canine has sniffed the car. Use this label if the vehicle smells of drug use (e.g., smells of raw or burnt marijuana or of chemicals such as meth or heroin) or contains drugs in plain view, or items used to ingest or use drugs such as pipes, syringes, needles, lighters, torches, drug paraphernalia, cigarette rolling papers (e.g., Raw or ZigZag brand rolling papers), marijuana cigarettes, joints, or blunts, vials, prescription bottles, or small glass containers used to hold drugs.  This label also applies if there are large amounts of cash or large bill denominations (e.g., $100 bills).
17. Suspicious Communications Device - Use this label if the officer observes suspicious communications devices such as multiple cell phones or a prepaid burner phone. 
18. Suspicious Storage - Use this label if only a small amount of luggage is visible given the stated nature of the trip, if the luggage is stored in the back of the cab instead of the trunk, if the vehicle has an unusual or secret storage compartment  or a car window that will not go down.
29. Suspicion Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect. 
20. Suspicion Not Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect.
21. No Factor - If none of the factors apply or the court is citing or quoting a legal rule, select this option.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

2. The data is in the form of an appellate court opinion.  Conclusions reached by a lower or a trial court should not be labelled.  Sample language would be "The district court concluded that the officer had probable cause for the search".

3. The charges before the court are not to be considered Legal Indications of Drug Use.  For example: "The defendant is charged with possession with intent to distribute," should not be labeled.  However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

8. Officer testimony can support the finding of a factor. 

You should apply a label for each sentence. Here are some examples: 

1. Sentence: Officer Guthrie testified that while the above exchanges were taking place, he noticed that the driver, Arturo Tapia, seemed nervous, and that his hands were shaking.
Label: Physical Appearance of Nervousness

2. Sentence: Upon reviewing the vehicle's documentation, Trooper Conrad discovered that the vehicle belonged to an absent third party, which, in his experience, raised his suspicion that the vehicle was being used for drug trafficking.
Label: Unusual Vehicle Ownership

3. Sentence: Typically, in my training and experience, the overwhelming smell of air fresheners in a rental vehicle is consistent with trying to mask the odor of controlled substances.
Label: Masking Agent, Unusual Vehicle Ownership

Sentence 3: Decision Date YYYY-MM-DD:  '2015-02-03', 
Sentence 4: ID No. :  4032152,     'OPINION
Sentence 5: HOWE, Judge:
Sentence 6: The State of Arizona appeals the superior court’s grant of Anthony Jerome Woods’s motion to suppress evidence of marijuana packages discovered in his car.
Sentence 7: The superior court ruled that a police officer did not have reasonable suspicion to detain Woods for a narcotics dog sniff of his car despite Woods’s extensive criminal history of drag transportation and the officer’s testimony that circumstances indicated that Woods’s actions were suspicious.
Sentence 8: Upon our de novo review whether the undisputed facts constitute reasonable suspicion, we hold that the police officer had reasonable suspicion to detain Woods for the dog sniff.
Sentence 9: We therefore reverse the superior court’s ruling and remand for further proceedings.
Sentence 10: FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Sentence 11: At the time of the evidentiary hearing, Officer McWhirter had served the Arizona Department of Public Safety as a patrol officer for more than 11 years.
Sentence 12: He had more than “200 some hours” of classroom training on drug interdiction and spent two months assigned to the Casa Grande drug canine unit riding with canine officers and “specifically working interdictions.”
Sentence 13: During his career, he had personally seized “a lot of drag loads” and “a lot of human smuggling loads.”
Sentence 14: In 2010 alone, he interdicted 1,500 pounds of marijuana and 14 pounds of cocaine and seized “between 50 and 75 vehicles” for human smuggling.
Sentence 15: ¶ 3 At 5:45 a.m. on November 23, 2010, Officer McWhirter stopped Woods on Interstate 10 in Chandler for swerving his car and traveling at varying speeds.
Sentence 16: The officer approached Woods to obtain his driver’s license and vehicle registration, which Woods provided, along with a rental car agreement.
Sentence 17: When the officer asked Woods where he was going, Woods stated that he was going to visit a friend in Phoenix who had cancer.
Sentence 18: Woods added that he was taking his friend to “rehab,” but could not identify which hospital or the type of rehabilitation.
Sentence 19: Woods’s answers “confused” and “perplexed”
Sentence 20: Officer McWhirter and made him suspicious.
Sentence 21: Seeing no personal belongings in the car, Officer McWhirter asked Woods if he planned to stay in Phoenix.
Sentence 22: Woods stated that he did not.
Sentence 23: The officer then ran a records cheek, which revealed that Woods had “a very, very big rap sheet with drugs” and “an extremely extensive background” of transporting and manufacturing drugs in Chicago.
Sentence 24: ¶ 5 Officer McWhirter then asked Woods for consent to search his car, and Woods agreed to the search and signed a consent form.
Sentence 25: The officer discovered two plain and unaddressed cardboard shipping boxes in the trunk.
Sentence 26: The boxes were sealed with tape and had a “very solid weight,” weighing between five and ten pounds.
Sentence 27: The officer believed that the boxes were consistent with packages used for transporting drugs.
Sentence 28: When the officer asked Woods about the contents of the boxes, Woods replied that they were “Christmas presents” that he was going to ship once he was in Phoenix.
Sentence 29: He asked Woods why the boxes “didn’t have any address labels or anything” and were “just completely plain.”
Sentence 30: Woods “didn’t have a good reason why they weren’t labeled” and merely said that he was going to do it in Phoenix.
Sentence 31: These statements and the discovery of the boxes further raised Officer McWhirter’s suspicions about Woods’s activity.
Sentence 32: He asked if he could open the packages, but Woods refused.
Sentence 33: ¶ 6 Officer McWhirter then requested that a narcotics dog be brought to the scene.
Sentence 34: No city police canine unit was on duty that early in the morning; the closest canine unit was in Maricopa.
Sentence 35: When that unit arrived about 40 minutes later, the narcotics dog sniffed the ear and alerted on the trunk and bit one of the boxes.
Sentence 36: A search of the boxes revealed marijuana.
Sentence 37: The State subsequently charged Woods with one count of sale or transportation of marijuana and alleged that Woods had several historical prior convictions and committed the offense while on community supervision release.
Sentence 38: ¶ 7 Woods moved to suppress evidence of the marijuana.
Sentence 39: Athough he did not contest the validity of the initial stop, he argued that once he refused to allow the officer to search the boxes, reasonable suspicion did not exist to detain him until the narcotics dog arrived.
Sentence 40: He also argued the length of his detention awaiting the narcotics dog was unreasonable.

Label the following sentences individually: 

Sentence 1: At the subsequent evidentiary hearing, the superior court heard testimony from Officer McWhirter about the stop and the search.
Sentence 2: The superior court suppressed the evidence.
Sentence 3: Athough the court found that the initial stop and subsequent search of the car pursuant to Woods’s consent were lawful, it ruled that once Woods refused to allow Officer McWhirter to search the boxes, Officer McWhirter had no information “to suggest a basis for reasonable suspicion as to the transportation of illegal substances.”
Sentence 4: The court acknowledged that Officer McWhirter believed that “the consistency and density of the boxes w[ere] consistent with his experience with packaging of illegal substances,” but without any other evidence found that “his beliefs were far more akin to speculation than reasonable suspicion.”
Sentence 5: The court found that the time of year — late November — and the location of the boxes — the car’s trunk— were consistent with Woods’s statement that the boxes were Christmas gifts.
Sentence 6: The court noted that “but for” the discovery of Woods’s prior criminal history of drug activity, “the officer would not have found anything to be suspicious about the packages.”
Sentence 7: ¶ 9 Following the suppression ruling, the State dismissed the charges and timely appealed.
Sentence 8: DISCUSSION
Sentence 9: ¶ 10 The State argues that the superi- or court erred by ruling that Officer McWhirter did not have reasonable suspicion to detain Woods to obtain a dog sniff of his rental car.
Sentence 10: In reviewing a superior court’s ruling that a detention and consequent search violated the Fourth Amendment, we defer to the superior court’s factual findings, but review de novo mixed questions of law and fact and the superior court’s ultimate legal conclusions about whether the totality of the circumstances warranted an investigative detention and whether its duration was reasonable.
Sentence 11: Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); State v. Teagle, 217 Ariz. 17, 22 ¶ 19, 170 P.3d 266, 271 (App.2007).
Sentence 12: ¶ 11 A police officer may make a limited investigatory stop if the officer has an “articulable, reasonable suspicion” that “the suspect is involved in criminal activity.”
Sentence 13: Teagle, 217 Ariz. at 22-23 ¶ 20, 170 P.3d at 271-72.
Sentence 14: “By definition, reasonable suspicion is something short of probable cause.”
Sentence 15: State v. O’Meara, 198 Ariz. 294, 296 ¶ 10, 9 P.3d 325, 327 (2000).
Sentence 16: While law enforcement must have more than a simple hunch or an “inchoate and unpartieularized suspicion,” reasonable suspicion requires a “minimal level of objective justification” and is “considerably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence.”
Sentence 17: Teagle, 217 Ariz. at 24 ¶¶ 25-26, 170 P.3d at 273.
Sentence 18: “In deciding whether the police have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting that a person is engaged in criminal activity, we look at the “whole picture,’ or the ‘totality of the circumstances,’ ” O’Meara, 198 Ariz. at 295 ¶ 7, 9 P.3d at 326.
Sentence 19: Considering the totality of the circumstances permits officers to draw on their specialized training — as well as their common sense knowledge about human behavior — to form their particularized and articulable basis for a stop.
Sentence 20: Teagle, 217 Ariz. at 24 ¶26, 170 P.3d at 273.
Sentence 21: “There is a ‘gestalt’ to the totality of the circumstances test.”
Sentence 22: O’Meara, 198 Ariz. at 296 ¶ 10, 9 P.3d at 327.
Sentence 23: ¶ 12 A suspect’s criminal history is part of the totality of the circumstances.
Sentence 24: It informs an officer’s judgment about whether criminal activity may be afoot and “may cast a suspicious light on ... seemingly innocent behavior.”
Sentence 25: United States v. Simpson, 609 F.3d 1140, 1147 (10th Cir.2010); see also United States v. Chamberlin, 644 F.2d 1262, 1265 (9th Cir.1980); State v. Lee, 265 Neb. 663, 658 N.W.2d 669, 678 (2003).
Sentence 26: Although such history cannot alone establish reasonable suspicion to support detention, United States v. Cotterman, 709 F.3d 952, 968 (9th Cir.2013), “[i]n conjunction with other factors, criminal history contributes powerfully to the reasonable suspicion calculus,” United States v.

Sentence 27: Accordingly, a suspect’s criminal history is part of the “totality of the circumstances” that informs an officer’s reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.
Sentence 28: In reviewing whether reasonable suspicion existed under the totality of the circumstances, “we accord deference to a trained law enforcement officer’s ability to distinguish between innocent and suspicious actions.”

TASK
In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.
-END LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-

-START INSTRUCTIONS-
YOU will assess sentences to and determine whether they belong to any of the following categories based on the content of the sentence and the descriptions below: 

1. Furtive Movement - Use this label if the driver or passenger in the vehicle makes a suspicious movement, such as reaching beneath a seat, or in a purse or bag, or around a waistband, or in a pocket, which is commonly an attempt to conceal contraband or a weapon.  This also includes attempting to evade custody such as taking a long time to pull the vehicle over.  Simple driving mistakes do not count under this factor.
2. Nervous Behavior or Appearance - Use this label if the motorist appears to be nervous, has shaking hands or a heavy heartbeat, or is sweating even though the temperature is cool.  Also use this label if the the motorist behaves in a nervous way, avoids making eye contact with the officer, focuses on a bag or compartment in the car, appears to be agitated, confronts the officer, gives the officer a curt response, volunteers too much information, or behaves in an overly friendly way toward the officer. 
3. Suspicious or Inconsistent Answers - Use this label if the driver made an answer to an officer that is evasive, nonsensical, inconsistent, contradictory, impossible, vague, incomplete, unusual, or untruthful.
4. Motorist license or Identification - Use this label if the motorist cannot provide the officer with a license or identification or if the license is invalid, revoked, fake, the wrong color, flimsy, or in someone else’s name. 
5. Driver Status - Use this label only if the driver of the vehicle is male, young, or not from the state in which the officer pulled the car over. 
6. Refused Consent - Use this label if the driver refused to consent to the officer’s request to search the automobile.
7. Legal Indications of Drug Use - Use this label if the motorist has an active arrest warrant for a drug related charge or if the motorist has been arrested for or convicted of a drug related offense in the past or if the officer knows that the motorist has abused, possessed, dealed, or trafficked in drugs in the past. 
8. Motorist's Appearance Related to Drug Use or Sale - Use this label if driver looks like they USE DRUGS such as needle track marks, rotten teeth, scabbing, bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils, unwashed hair, dirty clothes, body odor or dirty skin or if the driver is wearing suspicious clothing, such as expensive jewelry, expensive or luxury clothing, or clothing with images of drugs (e.g., marijuana leaves).
9. Possible Drug Route - Use this label if the driver’s route is from or to a city or area, which is known for drug trafficking or high crime rates, or if the driver stops the vehicle late at night or early in the morning in an area known for criminal activity. 
10. Unusual Travel Plans - Use this label if the motorist appears to be headed to a location that the motorist has already passed, is traveling on a road that does not lead to the stated destination, plans a trip that is too far to drive in a reasonable time (e.g., driving from Philadelphia to Miami in a single night), claims to be driving a long round trip in a one-day rental vehicle, or has other unusual travel plans.
11. Expensive Vehicle - Use this label if the motorist is driving a kind of vehicle associated with illicit drug use or trafficking such as a luxury or expensive vehicle, e.g., a BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, or Range Rover.
12. Vehicle License Plate or Registration - Use this label if the vehicle's license plate is missing, shielded from view, or from out of state, or if the license plate or vehicle registration has expired.
13. Unusual Vehicle Ownership - Use this label if the vehicle is rented or if the vehicle is owned by someone not in the vehicle, unknown to the driver, or about whom the driver knows very little or claims to be a distant relative. 
14. Indicia of Hard Travel - Use this label if the motorist has been driving a great distance for a long time and is attempting to make as few stops as possible, or if the vehicle contained fast-food bags, lots of trash, energy drinks or substances designed to keep the consumer awake, such as Redbull, Five-Hour Energy, or Energize Capsules. 
15. Masking Agent - Use this label if the vehicle contained a substance or product used to mask the odor of drugs such as air fresheners (e.g., Little Trees, Febreze, Glade, etc.), scented dryer sheets or baby wipes, or strongly smelling tobacco products, cigars or cigarettes or other strong smells.
16. Vehicle Contents Suggest Drugs - This label SHOULD NOT be used for anything found after a canine has sniffed the car. Use this label if the vehicle smells of drug use (e.g., smells of raw or burnt marijuana or of chemicals such as meth or heroin) or contains drugs in plain view, or items used to ingest or use drugs such as pipes, syringes, needles, lighters, torches, drug paraphernalia, cigarette rolling papers (e.g., Raw or ZigZag brand rolling papers), marijuana cigarettes, joints, or blunts, vials, prescription bottles, or small glass containers used to hold drugs.  This label also applies if there are large amounts of cash or large bill denominations (e.g., $100 bills).
17. Suspicious Communications Device - Use this label if the officer observes suspicious communications devices such as multiple cell phones or a prepaid burner phone. 
18. Suspicious Storage - Use this label if only a small amount of luggage is visible given the stated nature of the trip, if the luggage is stored in the back of the cab instead of the trunk, if the vehicle has an unusual or secret storage compartment  or a car window that will not go down.
29. Suspicion Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect. 
20. Suspicion Not Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect.
21. No Factor - If none of the factors apply or the court is citing or quoting a legal rule, select this option.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

2. The data is in the form of an appellate court opinion.  Conclusions reached by a lower or a trial court should not be labelled.  Sample language would be "The district court concluded that the officer had probable cause for the search".

3. The charges before the court are not to be considered Legal Indications of Drug Use.  For example: "The defendant is charged with possession with intent to distribute," should not be labeled.  However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

8. Officer testimony can support the finding of a factor. 

You should apply a label for each sentence. Here are some examples: 

1. Sentence: Officer Guthrie testified that while the above exchanges were taking place, he noticed that the driver, Arturo Tapia, seemed nervous, and that his hands were shaking.
Label: Physical Appearance of Nervousness

2. Sentence: Upon reviewing the vehicle's documentation, Trooper Conrad discovered that the vehicle belonged to an absent third party, which, in his experience, raised his suspicion that the vehicle was being used for drug trafficking.
Label: Unusual Vehicle Ownership

3. Sentence: Typically, in my training and experience, the overwhelming smell of air fresheners in a rental vehicle is consistent with trying to mask the odor of controlled substances.
Label: Masking Agent, Unusual Vehicle Ownership

-EXPECTED OUTPUT-
Sentence [Number]: [Sentence [number] contents]
Label: [label for sentence [number]]

Label the following sentences individually: 

Sentence 1: Woods had an extensive criminal history of transporting illegal drugs.
Sentence 2: In the trunk of the ear, Woods had two unlabeled boxes taped shut that had solid weights that were consistent with drug packages.
Sentence 3: These facts gave Officer McWhirter reason to suspect that Woods may be transporting illegal drugs and justified detaining Woods until the narcotics dog arrived.
Sentence 4: We review de novo the legal issue whether the facts as the superior court found them constitute reasonable suspicion.
Sentence 5: Orne-las, 517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657.
Sentence 6: As the superior court noted in its ruling, the facts were undisputed; the question was what the facts meant.
Sentence 7: The superior court ruled that in its view, Officer McWhirter’s beliefs about the meaning of the facts “were far more akin to speculation than reasonable suspicion.”
Sentence 8: That is the ultimate legal conclusion, however.
Sentence 9: Upon our de novo review of the record and considering that Woods was using a rental car with no personal belongings inside, provided confusing explanations about the purpose of his trip, had an extensive criminal history of drug transportation, and had two unlabeled taped boxes in the trunk of his ear that had a weight and density consistent with drug packages, we find that under the totality of the circumstances, Officer McWhirter had reasonable suspicion to detain Woods until the narcotics dog arrived.
Sentence 10: We therefore reverse the superior court’s ruling suppressing the evidence.
Sentence 11: Because the superior court did not rule on Woods’s motion that the length of his detention was unreasonable, we remand to the superior court for further proceedings.
Sentence 12: CONCLUSION
Sentence 13: ¶ 18 For these reasons, we reverse the ruling suppressing the evidence and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
Sentence 14: . Woods did not file an answering brief.
Sentence 15: "When a debatable issue is raised on [appeal], the failure to file an answering brief generally constitutes a confession of error.”
Sentence 16: Gibbons v. Indus.
Sentence 17: Comm’n of Ariz., 197 Ariz. 108, 111 ¶ 8, 3 P.3d 1028, 1031 (App.1999).
Sentence 18: We may, however, exercise our "discretion to waive this general rule to address a purely legal issue.”
Sentence 19: Because “[t]his case presents such an issue,” we address the merits of the State\'s appeal.
Sentence 20: Id.', 
Sentence 21: Dissenting/Concuring:  'Not Available',     Dissenting/Concuring 2:  'Not Available',     Dissenting/Concuring 3:  'Not Available'
