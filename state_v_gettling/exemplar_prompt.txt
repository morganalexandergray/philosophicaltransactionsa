TASK
In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.

21. No Factor - If none of the factors apply or the court is citing or quoting a legal rule, select this option.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

2. The data is in the form of an appellate court opinion.  Conclusions reached by a lower or a trial court should not be labelled.  Sample language would be "The district court concluded that the officer had probable cause for the search".

3. The charges before the court are not to be considered Legal Indications of Drug Use.  For example: "The defendant is charged with possession with intent to distribute," should not be labeled.  However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

8. Officer testimony can support the finding of a factor. 

You should apply a label for each sentence. Here are some examples: 

1. Sentence: Officer Guthrie testified that while the above exchanges were taking place, he noticed that the driver, Arturo Tapia, seemed nervous, and that his hands were shaking.
Label: Physical Appearance of Nervousness

2. Sentence: Upon reviewing the vehicle's documentation, Trooper Conrad discovered that the vehicle belonged to an absent third party, which, in his experience, raised his suspicion that the vehicle was being used for drug trafficking.
Label: Unusual Vehicle Ownership

3. Sentence: Typically, in my training and experience, the overwhelming smell of air fresheners in a rental vehicle is consistent with trying to mask the odor of controlled substances.
Label: Masking Agent, Unusual Vehicle Ownership

Sentence 3: Decision Date YYYY-MM-DD:  '2010-03-12', 
Sentence 4: ID No. :  6993398,     'PARRISH, Justice:
Sentence 5: INTRODUCTION
Sentence 6: Bradford Dale Gettling appeals the district court\'s denial of his motion to suppress.
Sentence 7: Police found drugs and drug paraphernalia in Gettling\'s personal belongings while conducting a search of the vehicle in which he had been traveling incident to the arrest of the vehicle\'s driver.
Sentence 8: During the pendency of this case, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Arizona v. Gant that officers could conduct a search of a vehicle incident to the arrest of a vehicle occupant only if the arres-tee could actually access the passenger compartment of the vehicle or i#f a failure to search could actually result in the loss of evidence pertaining to the crime underlying the arrest.
Sentence 9: - U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 1719, 178 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009).
Sentence 10: Because the police officers were not authorized to conduct a search of the vehicle incident to the driver\'s arrest, we hold that Mr. Gettling was illegally detained at the time officers conducted a dog sniff and subsequent search of the car.
Sentence 11: However, we apply the federal good-faith exception to the exelusionary rule and therefore uphold the denial of Mr. Get-tling\'s motion to suppress.
Sentence 12: BACKGROUND
Sentence 13: T2 On January 2, 2006, Deputy Shawn Radmall, a K-9 officer with the Utah County Sheriffs Department, pulled over a vehicle for an improper lane change and failure to come to a complete stop at a stop sign.
Sentence 14: The vehicle had three occupants Steven Canals, the driver; Amber Childs, the front seat passenger and vehicle owner; and Mr. Get-tling, the backseat passenger.
Sentence 15: None of the vehicle occupants held a valid driver license.
Sentence 16: After discovering that Mr. Canals had outstanding warrants and was driving with a suspended license, Deputy Radmall arrested him and placed him in the police eruiser.
Sentence 17: While effecting the arrest of Mr. Canals, Deputy Radmall noticed Mr. Gettling making furtive movements in the back seat and ordered him and Ms. Childs to exit the vehicle.
Sentence 18: Deputy Radmall then conducted a free air sniff around the exterior of the vehicle with his narcotics-detection dog.
Sentence 19: The dog indicated the presence of nareotics in two areas: (1) the top of the driver\'s window, and (2) the door handle of the back passenger-side door.
Sentence 20: After the positive indication, Deputy Radmall put the dog in the car, where it detected narcotics in Mr. Gettling\'s belongings.
Sentence 21: Upon searching those belongings, Deputy Radmall discovered methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia in a closed glasses case.
Sentence 22: Both the driver and the other passenger denied ownership, and Mr. Gettling indicated by nodding that the glasses case and its contents belonged to him.
Sentence 23: He later entered a conditional guilty plea, which allowed him to appeal the district court\'s denial of his motion to suppress the evidence.
Sentence 24: ANALYSIS
Sentence 25: POLICE OFFICERS CAN DETAIN PASSENGERS UNTIL THE PURPOSE OF THE TRAFFIC STOP HAS BEEN COMPLETED
Sentence 26: 13 Mr. Gettling argues that he was illegally detained at the time Deputy Rad-mall conducted the free air sniff with his narcotics-detection dog and that the drugs and drug paraphernalia found in the subsequent search of his belongings should be suppressed.
Sentence 27: The State counters that Mr. Gettling was lawfully detained at the time of the search because Deputy Radmall was still permitted to conduct a search incident to the arrest of the driver and thus had not concluded the lawful purpose of the stop at the time of the canine sniff.
Sentence 28: After the Supreme Court issued Arizona v. Gant, - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009), clarifying that officers are not permitted to conduct routine searches incident to arrest, the State filed a supplemental brief arguing that Gant does not apply to situations with unsecured passengers, that Deputy Radmall had further need to control the scene, and that the dog sniff was only a de minimis extension of the lawful traffic stop.
Sentence 29: The State alternatively argues that Gant should not have retroactive application.
Sentence 30: We determine that the purpose of the stop concluded after the arrest of the driver.
Sentence 31: Thereafter, Deputy Radmall had no continued justification to detain the passengers.
Sentence 32: However, while Mr. Gettling was unlawfully detained at the time of the search, we apply the federal good-faith exception to the exelu-sionary rule to any evidence discovered as a result of the unlawful detention.
Sentence 33: 15 Police can detain individuals on reasonable articulable suspicion that they are engaged or about to be engaged in criminal activity.
Sentence 34: State v. James, 2000 UT 80, ¶ 10, 13 P.3d 576.
Sentence 35: Observing a vehicle commit a traffic violation gives police probable cause to detain the driver and passengers of the vehicle.
Sentence 36: Arizona v. Johnson, - U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 781, 788, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009).
Sentence 37: If, during the course of a lawful traffic stop, an officer gains further suspicion that a vehicle occupant is engaged in illegal activity, the officer can detain the vehicle further in order to investigate.
Sentence 38: State v. Hansen, 2002 UT 125, ¶ 31, 63 P.3d 650.
Sentence 39: When officers have concluded their investigation of their initial suspicion and any further suspicion that arose during the stop, they are required to end the detention.
Sentence 40: "[E)ven a small intrusion beyond the legitimate scope of an initially lawful search is unlawful under the Fourth Amendment."
Sentence 41: State v. Schlosser, 774 P.2d 1132, 1135 (Utah 1989) (citing Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321, 825, 107 S.Ct. 1149, 94 L.Ed.2d 847 (1987)).
Sentence 42: T6 In State v. Baker, also announced today, we held that when a traffic stop eulmi-nates in the arrest of the driver, the "officers must release any passengers who were detained incident to the detention of the vehicle" after the officer has completed all procedures incident to the arrest of the driver.
Sentence 43: Baker, 2010 UT 18, ¶ 18, 229 P.3d 650.
Sentence 44: We also declined to adopt any de minimis exception to a passenger\'s Fourth Amendment rights in order to allow officers to conduct a canine sniff after the lawful purpose of the stop has concluded.
Sentence 45: ¶¶ 30, 33; see also Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 407-08, 125 S.Ct. 834, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005) (finding that although a dog sniff by a trained narcotics-detection dog is not a search, it is not lawful to conduct a dog sniff if it prolongs the stop).
Sentence 46: However, because the detention of the passengers in Baker took place while officers were conducting a routine search incident to arrest, a search allowed prior to the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Gant, 129 S.Ct. 1710, we determined that application of the federal exclusionary rule would not deter the police from unlawful conduct.
Sentence 47: Baker ¶ 39.
Sentence 48: We therefore applied the federal good-faith exception to the exelu-sionary rule to searches conducted by officers in reliance on Judicial precedent authorizing a search of a vehicle incident to the arrest of a vehicle occupant.
Sentence 49: In this case, Deputy Radmall detained Mr. Gettling while conducting a search incident to driver\'s arrest that, prior to Gant, would have been constitutional.
Sentence 50: At the time of Mr. Gettling\'s detention, Deputy Radmall had no reasonable articulable suspicion that Mr. Gettling was involved in criminal activity and thus could not continue to detain him after he completed the arrest of the driver.
Sentence 51: But Deputy Radmall did detain Mr. Gettling as he cireled the vehicle with the narcotics-detection dog.
Sentence 52: The fact that Mr. Gettling may have made "furtive movements" in the back seat is not sufficient justification to allow the officers to extend the stop.
Sentence 53: Schlosser, 774 P.2d at 1137 ("Mere furtive gestures of an occupant of an automobile do not give rise to an articulable suspicion suggesting criminal activity.").
Sentence 54: Additionally, the fact that Deputy Radmaill\'s nareoties-detection dog was present in his patrol vehicle at the time of the stop, rather than arriving on the scene after the lawful purposes of the stop had concluded, has no bearing on whether the stop was improperly extended.
Sentence 55: Once the lawful purpose of the stop concluded, Deputy Radmall was required to release the passengers.
Sentence 56: However, the evidence uncovered during the search of the vehicle should not be excluded because Deputy Radmall relied on settled precedent to search the vehicle incident to the arrest of its driver.
Sentence 57: CONCLUSION
Sentence 58: T8 Although Deputy Radmall violated Mr. Gettling\'s Fourth Amendment rights by detaining him after concluding the lawful purpose of the traffic stop, we apply the federal good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule and uphold the district court\'s denial of Mr. Gettling\'s motion to suppress.
