TASK
In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.

-START INSTRUCTIONS-
YOU will assess sentences to and determine whether they belong to any of the following categories based on the content of the sentence and the descriptions below: 

1. Furtive Movement - Use this label if the driver or passenger in the vehicle makes a suspicious movement, such as reaching beneath a seat, or in a purse or bag, or around a waistband, or in a pocket, which is commonly an attempt to conceal contraband or a weapon.  This also includes attempting to evade custody such as taking a long time to pull the vehicle over. 
2. Nervous Behavior or Appearance - Use this label if the motorist appears to be nervous, has shaking hands or a heavy heartbeat, or is sweating even though the temperature is cool.

8. Motorist's Appearance Related to Drug Use or Sale - Use this label if driver looks like they USE DRUGS such as needle track marks, rotten teeth, scabbing, bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils, unwashed hair, dirty clothes, body odor or dirty skin or if the driver is wearing suspicious clothing, such as expensive jewelry, expensive or luxury clothing, or clothing with images of drugs (e.g., marijuana leaves).
9. Possible Drug Route - Use this label if the driver’s route is from or to a city or area, which is known for drug trafficking or high crime rates, or if the driver stops the vehicle late at night or early in the morning in an area known for criminal activity. 
10. Unusual Travel Plans - Use this label if the motorist appears to be headed to a location that the motorist has already passed, is traveling on a road that does not lead to the stated destination, plans a trip that is too far to drive in a reasonable time (e.g., driving from Philadelphia to Miami in a single night), claims to be driving a long round trip in a one-day rental vehicle, or has other unusual travel plans.
11. Expensive Vehicle - Use this label if the motorist is driving a kind of vehicle associated with illicit drug use or trafficking such as a luxury or expensive vehicle, e.g., a BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, or Range Rover.
12. Vehicle License Plate or Registration - Use this label if the vehicle's license plate is missing, shielded from view, or from out of state, or if the license plate or vehicle registration has expired.
13. Unusual Vehicle Ownership - Use this label if the vehicle is rented or if the vehicle is owned by someone not in the vehicle, unknown to the driver, or about whom the driver knows very little or claims to be a distant relative. 
14. Indicia of Hard Travel - Use this label if the motorist has been driving a great distance for a long time and is attempting to make as few stops as possible, or if the vehicle contained fast-food bags, lots of trash, energy drinks or substances designed to keep the consumer awake, such as Redbull, Five-Hour Energy, or Energize Capsules. 
15. Masking Agent - Use this label if the vehicle contained a substance or product used to mask the odor of drugs such as air fresheners (e.g., Little Trees, Febreze, Glade, etc.), scented dryer sheets or baby wipes, or strongly smelling tobacco products, cigars or cigarettes or other strong smells.
16. Vehicle Contents Suggest Drugs - Use this label if the vehicle smells of drug use (e.g., smells of raw or burnt marijuana or of chemicals such as meth or heroin) or contains drugs in plain view, or items used to ingest or use drugs such as pipes, syringes, needles, lighters, torches, drug paraphernalia, cigarette rolling papers (e.g., Raw or ZigZag brand rolling papers), marijuana cigarettes, joints, or blunts, vials, prescription bottles, or small glass containers used to hold drugs  This label also applies if there are large amounts of cash or large bill denominations (e.g., $100 bills),.
17. Suspicious Communications Device - Use this label if the officer observes suspicious communications devices such as multiple cell phones or a prepaid burner phone. 
18. Suspicious Storage - Use this label if only a small amount of luggage is visible given the stated nature of the trip, if the luggage is stored in the back of the cab instead of the trunk, if the vehicle has an unusual or secret storage compartment  or a car window that will not go down.
29. Suspicion Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect. 
20. Suspicion Not Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect.
21. No Factor - If none of the factors apply or the court is citing or quoting a legal rule, select this option.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

2. The data is in the form of an appellate court opinion.  Conclusions reached by a lower or a trial court should not be labelled.  Sample language would be "The district court concluded that the officer had probable cause for the search".

3. The charges before the court are not to be considered Legal Indications of Drug Use.  For example: "The defendant is charged with possession with intent to distribute," should not be labeled.  However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

8. Officer testimony can support the finding of a factor. 

You should apply a label for each sentence. Here are some examples: 

1. Sentence: Officer Guthrie testified that while the above exchanges were taking place, he noticed that the driver, Arturo Tapia, seemed nervous, and that his hands were shaking.
Label: Physical Appearance of Nervousness

2. Sentence: Upon reviewing the vehicle's documentation, Trooper Conrad discovered that the vehicle belonged to an absent third party, which, in his experience, raised his suspicion that the vehicle was being used for drug trafficking.
Label: Unusual Vehicle Ownership

3. Sentence: Typically, in my training and experience, the overwhelming smell of air fresheners in a rental vehicle is consistent with trying to mask the odor of controlled substances.
Label: Masking Agent, Unusual Vehicle Ownership

Label all of these 60 sentences: 
Label: 

Sentence 1: Case Name:  'UNITED STATES of America v. Rodney Wesley FRIERSON, Appellant', 
Sentence 2: Citation:  "611 F. App'x 82",     Court Name:  'United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit', 
Sentence 3: Decision Date YYYY-MM-DD:  '2015-06-02', 
Sentence 4: ID No. :  4314870,     'OPINION
Sentence 5: ROTH, Circuit Judge.
Sentence 6: Defendant Rodney Frierson appeals his conviction for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute, and possession with intent to distribute, 500 grams or more of cocaine; possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking; and being a felon in possession of a firearm.
Sentence 7: Frier- son argues that the District Court erred by failing to suppress evidence obtained during a detention and frisk, and by denying his motion for new trial.
Sentence 8: For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.
Sentence 9: At around 10:30 a.m. on January 15, 2010, Pennsylvania State Trooper Justin Hope was positioned at an entrance ramp to the Pennsylvania Turnpike and observed two men in an SUV, with an Ohio license plate, entering the Turnpike.
Sentence 10: Hope followed the vehicle and, at around 10:44 a.m., pulled it over for speeding.
Sentence 11: Hope later testified that, based on his experience, there were several circumstances making him suspicious that the men might be trafficking drugs.
Sentence 12: He noted that (1) there were two people in the vehicle, (2) the vehicle was a rented SUV with an out-of-state license, (3) the driver did not look at him as he passed and had his hands in the “10-and-2 position” on the wheel, (4) it was mid-Friday morning, and (5) the men were driving away from Philadelphia.
Sentence 13: Once Hope approached the vehicle, he requested the driver’s license and registration.
Sentence 14: Frierson, who was driving the vehicle, handed Hope his California license and an Enterprise rental agreement.
Sentence 15: Angel Anderson, the passenger, also gave Hope a California license and told Hope that he had rented the car.
Sentence 16: Hope noticed three cell phones in the SUV’s center console.
Sentence 17: When Hope returned to his vehicle, he ran Frierson and Anderson’s licenses and discovered that Frierson had an extensive criminal history, including convictions for voluntary manslaughter, possession of an assault weapon and body armor, and cocaine possession, transportation, or sale.
Sentence 18: Hope then contacted his backup, Trooper Luke Straniere, and attempted to locate a K-9 sniffing unit.
Sentence 19: Hope also sought information from the El Paso Intelligence Center, which reported Frierson had crossed into Mexico from California four times in 2009.
Sentence 20: Hope also reviewed the rental agreement, which had expired over a week earlier and indicated that Anderson was the only authorized driver.
Sentence 21: At 11:10 a.m., Straniere arrived.
Sentence 22: At this time, Hope approached the SUV again.
Sentence 23: Anderson explained that the rental agreement had been extended, and Hope told them that Anderson was going to have to drive the car.
Sentence 24: At approximately 11:14 a.m., Straniere confirmed from Enterprise that the rental agreement had been extended and learned that Anderson rented from Enterprise five times in the previous four months.
Sentence 25: The officers then approached the SUV and asked Frierson to exit the vehicle.
Sentence 26: After Frierson refused to consent to a frisk or respond to questions regarding his criminal history, Straniere patted him down and felt a gun on his right side.
Sentence 27: Because Frierson had a felony conviction, he was arrested for being a felon in possession of a firearm.
Sentence 28: The troopers later seized 995 grams of cocaine from luggage in the SUV.
Sentence 29: Frierson first argues that the extension of the traffic stop violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment.
Sentence 30: “A lawful roadside stop begins when a vehicle is pulled over for investigation of a traffic violation.”
Sentence 31: The “tolerable duration of police inquiries in the traffic-stop context is determined by the seizure’s ‘mission’ — to address the traffic violation that warranted the stop and attend to related safety concerns.”
Sentence 32: Authority for the seizure therefore ends “when tasks tied to the traffic infraction are — or reasonably should have been — completed.”
Sentence 33: An officer may, however, expand the scope of a traffic stop and detain the vehicle and its occupants for further investigation if he “develops a reasonable, articula-ble suspicion of criminal activity.”
Sentence 34: “While ‘reasonable suspicion’ ” must be more than an inchoate ‘hunch,’ the Fourth Amendment only requires that police articulate some minimal, objective justification for an investigatory stop.”
Sentence 35: Courts must consider the totality of the circumstances in light of the officer’s experience.
Sentence 36: While “individual factors giving rise to reasonable suspicion may be innocent in isolation, together they ‘must serve to eliminate a substantial portion of innocent travelers.’ ”
Sentence 37: Upon initially detaining the men, Hope reasonably addressed the traffic violation that warranted the stop and attended to safety concerns.
Sentence 38: For example, any preliminary delay in checking Frierson’s license, registration, and criminal history was justified as part of the stop.
Sentence 39: Similarly, it was reasonable for Hope to delay the stop in order to investigate who was authorized to drive the rental car.
Sentence 40: Once Hope discovered Frierson’s criminal history, he decided to wait for backup out of concern for his safety in effectuating the traffic stop.
Sentence 41: Although Straniere did not arrive until 11:10 a.m., twenty-six minutes into the stop, this delay was not due to Hope’s unreasonable actions but to circumstances beyond his control.
Sentence 42: Once Straniere arrived, he and Hope acted reasonably in calling Enterprise to determine whether the rental agreement had been extended.
Sentence 43: At this point, Hope had reasonable and articulable suspicion that Frierson and Anderson may have been trafficking drugs, justifying the expansion of the investigation’s scope.
Sentence 44: The factors were: (1) the SUV and its occupants were from another state, (2) the SUV was a rental, (3) there were three cell phones in the console, (4)
Sentence 45: Frierson had an extensive criminal history, (5)
Sentence 46: Frierson had crossed into Mexico four times in 2009, and (6)
Sentence 47: Anderson had rented five cars in the past four months.
Sentence 48: Although some factors are innocent individually, together they eliminate a substantial portion of innocent travelers and therefore give rise to reasonable suspicion.
Sentence 49: Frierson next argues that the subsequent frisk was invalid.
Sentence 50: An officer may perform a frisk if he has reasonable suspicion that the individual is armed or dangerous based on the totality of the circumstances.
Sentence 51: The purpose is “not to discover evidence of a crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence.”
Sentence 52: Here, the officers had reasonable suspicion to believe that Frierson was dangerous based on his violent history and on their suspicion that he was engaged in drug trafficking.
Sentence 53: Their safety concerns were also justified by Fri-erson’s appearance — specifically, that he wore a loose long-sleeved shirt that extended below his waist.
Sentence 54: Accordingly, it was reasonable to conclude that a frisk was necessary to ensure the officers’ safety.
Sentence 55: For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s denial of Frier-son’s motion to suppress and motion for a new trial.
Sentence 56: This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.
Sentence 57: . "We review a district court’s order denying a motion to suppress under a mixed standard of review.
Sentence 58: We review findings of fact for clear error, but we exercise plenary review over legal determinations."
Sentence 59: United States v. Lewis, 672 F.3d 232, 236-37 (3d Cir.2012) (internal citation omitted).
Sentence 60: We review rulings on admissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion, United States v. Gibbs, 190 F.3d 188, 211 (3d Cir.1999), but conduct plenary review over whether the error was harmless, see Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 295, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991).

Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family.

The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.
