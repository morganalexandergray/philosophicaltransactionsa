TASK
In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.

-START INSTRUCTIONS-
YOU will assess sentences to and determine whether they belong to any of the following categories based on the content of the sentence and the descriptions below: 

1. Furtive Movement - Use this label if the driver or passenger in the vehicle makes a suspicious movement, such as reaching beneath a seat, or in a purse or bag, or around a waistband, or in a pocket, which is commonly an attempt to conceal contraband or a weapon.  This also includes attempting to evade custody such as taking a long time to pull the vehicle over. 
2. Nervous Behavior or Appearance - Use this label if the motorist appears to be nervous, has shaking hands or a heavy heartbeat, or is sweating even though the temperature is cool.  Also use this label if the the motorist behaves in a nervous way, avoids making eye contact with the officer, focuses on a bag or compartment in the car, appears to be agitated, confronts the officer, gives the officer a curt response, volunteers too much information, or behaves in an overly friendly way toward the officer. 
3. Suspicious or Inconsistent Answers - Use this label if the driver made an answer to an officer that is evasive, nonsensical, inconsistent, contradictory, impossible, vague, incomplete, unusual, or untruthful.
4. Motorist license or Identification - Use this label if the motorist cannot provide the officer with a license or identification or if the license is invalid, revoked, fake, the wrong color, flimsy, or in someone else’s name. 
5. Driver Status - Use this label only if the driver of the vehicle is male, young, or not from the state in which the officer pulled the car over. 
6. Refused Consent - Use this label if the driver refused to consent to the officer’s request to search the automobile.
7. Legal Indications of Drug Use - Use this label if the motorist has an active arrest warrant for a drug related charge or if the motorist has been arrested for or convicted of a drug related offense in the past or if the officer knows that the motorist has abused, possessed, dealed, or trafficked in drugs in the past. 
8. Motorist's Appearance Related to Drug Use or Sale - Use this label if driver looks like they're using drugs such as powder on a face, needle track marks, rotten teeth, scabbing, bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils, unwashed hair, dirty clothes, body odor or dirty skin or if the driver is wearing suspicious clothing, such as expensive jewelry, expensive or luxury clothing, or clothing with images of drugs (e.g., marijuana leaves).
9. Possible Drug Route - Use this label if the driver’s route is from or to a city or area, which is known for drug trafficking or high crime rates, or if the driver stops the vehicle late at night or early in the morning in an area known for criminal activity. 
10. Unusual Travel Plans - Use this label if the motorist appears to be headed to a location that the motorist has already passed, is traveling on a road that does not lead to the stated destination, plans a trip that is too far to drive in a reasonable time (e.g., driving from Philadelphia to Miami in a single night), claims to be driving a long round trip in a one-day rental vehicle, or has other unusual travel plans.
11. Expensive Vehicle - Use this label if the motorist is driving a kind of vehicle associated with illicit drug use or trafficking such as a luxury or expensive vehicle, e.g., a BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, or Range Rover.
12. Vehicle License Plate or Registration - Use this label if the vehicle's license plate is missing, shielded from view, or from out of state, or if the license plate or vehicle registration has expired.
13. Unusual Vehicle Ownership - Use this label if the vehicle is rented or if the vehicle is owned by someone not in the vehicle, unknown to the driver, or about whom the driver knows very little or claims to be a distant relative. 
14. Indicia of Hard Travel - Use this label if the motorist has been driving a great distance for a long time and is attempting to make as few stops as possible, or if the vehicle contained fast-food bags, lots of trash, energy drinks or substances designed to keep the consumer awake, such as Redbull, Five-Hour Energy, or Energize Capsules. 
15. Masking Agent - Use this label if the vehicle contained a substance or product used to mask the odor of drugs such as air fresheners (e.g., Little Trees, Febreze, Glade, etc.), scented dryer sheets or baby wipes, or strongly smelling tobacco products, cigars or cigarettes or other strong smells.
16. Vehicle Contents Suggest Drugs - Use this label if the vehicle smells of drug use (e.g., smells of raw or burnt marijuana or of chemicals such as meth or heroin) or contains drugs in plain view, or items used to ingest or use drugs such as pipes, syringes, needles, lighters, torches, drug paraphernalia, cigarette rolling papers (e.g., Raw or ZigZag brand rolling papers), marijuana cigarettes, joints, or blunts, vials, prescription bottles, or small glass containers used to hold drugs  This label also applies if there are large amounts of cash or large bill denominations (e.g., $100 bills),.
17. Suspicious Communications Device - Use this label if the officer observes suspicious communications devices such as multiple cell phones or a prepaid burner phone. 
18. Suspicious Storage - Use this label if only a small amount of luggage is visible given the stated nature of the trip, if the luggage is stored in the back of the cab instead of the trunk, if the vehicle has an unusual or secret storage compartment  or a car window that will not go down.
29. Suspicion Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect. 
20. Suspicion Not Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect.
21. No Factor - If none of the factors apply or the court is citing or quoting a legal rule, select this option.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

2. The data is in the form of an appellate court opinion.  Conclusions reached by a lower or a trial court should not be labelled.  Sample language would be "The district court concluded that the officer had probable cause for the search".

3. The charges before the court are not to be considered Legal Indications of Drug Use.  For example: "The defendant is charged with possession with intent to distribute," should not be labeled.  However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

8. Officer testimony can support the finding of a factor. 

Along with a label, you should also provide a rationale for assigning a label. Here are some examples: 

1. Sentence: Officer Guthrie testified that while the above exchanges were taking place, he noticed that the driver, Arturo Tapia, seemed nervous, and that his hands were shaking.
Label: Physical Appearance of Nervousness

2. Sentence: Upon reviewing the vehicle's documentation, Trooper Conrad discovered that the vehicle belonged to an absent third party, which, in his experience, raised his suspicion that the vehicle was being used for drug trafficking.
Label: Unusual Vehicle Ownership

3. Sentence: Typically, in my training and experience, the overwhelming smell of air fresheners in a rental vehicle is consistent with trying to mask the odor of controlled substances.
Label: Masking Agent, Unusual Vehicle Ownership

Label all of these 60 sentences: 
Label: 
Rationale: 

Sentence 1: Case Name:  'UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. Albert POWELL, III, Defendant-Appellant',
Sentence 2: Citation:  "277 F. App'x 782",     Court Name:  'United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit', 
Sentence 3: Decision Date YYYY-MM-DD:  '2008-05-07', 
Sentence 4: ID No. :  4077446,     'ORDER AND JUDGMENT
Sentence 5: NEIL M. GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.
Sentence 6: Albert Powell challenges the district court’s denial of his motion to suppress drugs found in a search of his vehicle.
Sentence 7: Specifically, Mr. Powell argues that his traffic stop should have ended after a sheriffs deputy issued him a warning citation and that his further detention for questioning was unlawful.
Sentence 8: Like the district court, however, we hold that reasonable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to support a lawful investigative detention existed at the time the initial traffic stop ended; accordingly, we affirm.
Sentence 9: While patrolling Interstate 70 in Kansas late one morning in May 2006, Shawnee County Sheriffs Deputy Tracey Trammel observed an eastbound white GMC Yukon cross over the fog line on two separate occasions within a quarter of a mile.
Sentence 10: Other vehicles were not having difficulty remaining on the road, and no road, weather, or traffic conditions explained the weaving, so Deputy Trammel stopped the Yukon.
Sentence 11: Deputy Trammel approached the vehicle on the passenger side and explained to Mr. Powell, the driver and sole occupant, why he stopped him and asked if he was tired or had been drinking.
Sentence 12: Mr. Powell responded in the negative and then, without any prompting from the deputy, began volunteering information.
Sentence 13: Mr. Powell told Deputy Trammel that he rented the Yukon to move from Colorado to Lexington, Kentucky, where he planned to open a hip-hop clothing store.
Sentence 14: He explained that he was transporting tires for his Chevy Suburban, which he owned but left at home in Colorado, because the tires were not made for long distance highway driving.
Sentence 15: He added that he planned to unload the tires in Lexington before returning to Colorado to turn in his rental vehicle and pick up his Suburban.
Sentence 16: Mr. Powell went on to say that he was traveling with his brother, who was “up ahead” because he did not wait for Mr. Powell when Mr. Powell stopped to use the restroom.
Sentence 17: During Mr. Powell’s narrative, Deputy Trammel observed that Mr. Powell appeared “extremely nervous” because, in addition to his talkativeness, he was breathing heavily and avoiding eye contact.
Sentence 18: The deputy also detected a “[r]eal strong-deodorizer smell,” specifically the smell of fabric softener, which he later testified is often used to mask the odor of illegal drugs.
Sentence 19: Appellee’s Supp. App. at 17, 21.
Sentence 20: He further observed that the Yukon was “probably half full,” containing four large tires and several boxes.
Sentence 21: Id. at 18-19.
Sentence 22: After Mr. Powell explained his travel plans, Deputy Trammel requested his license and rental agreement, which Mr. Powell produced and Deputy Trammel took to his patrol car.
Sentence 23: The rental agreement showed that Mr. Powell rented the Yukon the day before and was supposed to return it three days after the rental date.
Sentence 24: Although there was some confusion about the status of Mr. Powell’s license, dispatch ultimately informed Deputy Trammel that it was expired or canceled.
Sentence 25: Deputy Trammel again approached Mr. Powell’s vehicle on the passenger side, returned his license and rental agreement, and issued him a warning citation for the lane violation.
Sentence 26: The deputy thanked Mr. Powell and appeared ready to return to his patrol car, but then paused briefly and inquired if he could ask a few additional questions.
Sentence 27: Before the district court, Deputy Trammel and Mr. Powell disputed whether Mr. Powell agreed.
Sentence 28: But they do agree that Deputy Trammel went on to ask if Mr. Powell was transporting anything illegal such as marijuana, heroin, cocaine, or weapons.
Sentence 29: Looking at the floor, Mr. Powell answered that he was not.
Sentence 30: Deputy Trammel then sought permission to search the vehicle, but Mr. Powell refused.
Sentence 31: Believing he already had reasonable suspicion to detain Mr. Powell for a canine sniff of his vehicle, Deputy Trammel asked Mr. Powell to exit the vehicle and walked the drug detection dog traveling in his patrol car around the Yukon’s perimeter.
Sentence 32: The dog alerted, and Deputy Trammel explained to Mr. Powell that this gave him reason to look inside the vehicle.
Sentence 33: Upon searching the Yukon, Deputy Trammel found marijuana in a box labeled “AP bedroom,” which was emitting a strong deodorizer odor.
Sentence 34: Ultimately, the government charged Mr. Powell with possessing with intent to distribute approximately 119 kilograms of a mixture or substance containing marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B).
Sentence 35: Mr. Powell moved to suppress the drugs found as a result of the search, arguing that his initial stop and later detention were illegal.
Sentence 36: The district court concluded that both the initial stop for a traffic infraction and the detention that occurred after the initial stop ended were based on reasonable suspicion and therefore denied the motion to suppress.
Sentence 37: After this ruling, Mr. Powell entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the suppression order.
Sentence 38: On appeal, Mr. Powell does not contest the legality of the initial traffic stop for lane violations, so the only issue before us is whether his continued detention for additional questioning and a canine sniff of his vehicle, after the traffic stop ended, complied with the Fourth Amendment.
Sentence 39: We approach this question, as in all appeals from a district court’s order on a motion to suppress, viewing the record evidence in the light most favorable to the district court’s ruling and accepting its factual findings unless clearly erroneous, though we assess de novo the ultimate legal question whether the seizure was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.
Sentence 40: United States v. Cortez-Galaviz, 495 F.3d 1203,1205 (10th Cir.2007).
Sentence 41: A routine traffic stop effects an investigative detention, which generally must “last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop,” and the scope of which “must be carefully tailored to its underlying justification.”
Sentence 42: Florida v. Roger, 460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983); see United States v. Hunnicutt, 135 F.3d 1345, 1348 (10th Cir.1998).
Sentence 43: To extend the detention beyond the initial stop, an officer must have objectively reasonable and articulable suspicion that illegal activity is afoot, or the initial detention must have become a consensual encounter.
Sentence 44: Hunnicutt, 135 F.3d at 1349.
Sentence 45: In this case, the parties agree that the initial traffic stop ended after Deputy Trammel returned Mr. Powell’s license and rental agreement and issued him a warning citation.
Sentence 46: The detention in question thus began when Deputy Trammel then inquired if he could ask Mr. Powell more questions.
Sentence 47: Before us, the government does not pursue the argument that Mr. Powell consented to this continued detention, so our inquiry is limited to assessing whether, as a matter of law, reasonable suspicion of criminal activity existed at the time the initial traffic stop ended.
Sentence 48: In deciding whether reasonable suspicion existed to support an investigative detention, we consider the totality of the circumstances, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, to determine whether a particularized and objective basis existed for suspecting illegal activity.
Sentence 49: United States v. Lopez, 518 F.3d 790, 797 (10th Cir.2008).
Sentence 50: We evaluate the officer’s conduct in light of common sense and ordinary human experience, at the same time granting deference to a trained officer’s “ability to distinguish between innocent and suspicious circumstances.”
Sentence 51: Id. (quotation omitted).
Sentence 52: “Our task ... is not to pigeonhole each purported fact as either consistent with innocent travel or manifestly suspicious, but rather to determine whether the totality of the circumstances justify the detention.”
Sentence 53: United States v. Mendez, 118 F.3d 1426, 1431 (10th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted).
Sentence 54: The reasonable suspicion standard thus “requires an officer to have ‘some minimal level of objective justification,’ but he or she ‘need not rule out the possibility of innocent conduct as long as the totality of the circumstances suffices to form a particularized and objective basis for [an investigative] stop.’ ” Cortez-Galaviz, 495 F.3d at 1206 (quoting INS v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210, 217, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984) and United States v. Vercher, 358 F.3d 1257, 1261 (10th Cir.2004)).
Sentence 55: In this case, several factors recognized by ornease law as contributing to reasonable suspicion lead us to conclude that standard was met.
Sentence 56: First, Deputy Trammel testified that he detected a strong odor of deodorizer, specifically fabric softener, in Mr. Powell’s vehicle, and that such odors are often used to mask the smell of illegal drugs:
Sentence 57: [I]n my training and experience, using masking odors such as laundry detergent, Febreze, ah’ fresheners, what they’re trying to do is mask the odor of the contraband that’s in the vehicle, just so you can’t smell it through your human nose.
Sentence 58: Only thing you can smell is them kind of masking odors.
Sentence 59: This one here smelled of fabric softeners, which a fabric softener is uncommon in a vehicle because that’s what you do laundry with.
Sentence 60: Appellee’s Supp. App. at 21.

In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

Hernandez-Rodriguez, 57 F.3d 895, 898 (10th Cir.1995) (strong smell of perfume supported reasonable suspicion that it was masking odor of drugs); United States v. Stone, 866 F.2d 359, 362 (10th Cir.1989) (odor of patchouli oil, used to mask other smells, contributed to reasonable suspicion of drug possession); see also United States v. West, 219 F.3d 1171, 1178-79 (10th Cir.2000) (“The Tenth Circuit has consistently held that the scent of air freshener is properly considered as a factor in the probable cause analysis.”).
Sentence 3: Second, Mr. Powell was driving a rental vehicle, a practice that, while of course consistent with lawful activity, we have also previously credited as common among drug couriers.
Sentence 4: See United States v. Contreras, 506 F.3d 1031, 1036 (10th Cir.2007) (considering, as contributing to reasonable suspicion, the fact that rental cars are “often used by narcotics traffickers”); United States v. Williams, 271 F.3d 1262, 1270 (10th Cir.2001).
Sentence 5: Contributing to the suspiciousness of Mr. Powell’s use of a rental vehicle in this case is the fact that he rented a GMC Yukon but told Deputy Trammel that he owned a Chevy Suburban — essentially the exact same vehicle— which he left at home.
Sentence 6: As Deputy Trammel observed, the fact that Mr. Powell rented a Yukon instead of using his Suburban for the trip undercut the plausibility of his story:
Sentence 7: [The vehicles are] equal in size, which that was another thing that I took note on, is that if you’ve got a vehicle of the same size, why would you pay all the money to rent a vehicle?
Sentence 8: He had the same vehicle sitting at home that he could have used.
Sentence 9: And this vehicle here wasn’t completely full anyway, so it wasn’t for any type of room.
Sentence 10: And in comparison, it was actually the same.
Sentence 11: Appellee’s Supp. App. at 22-23.
Sentence 12: An officer’s suspicion may reasonably be aroused where, as here, a defendant’s proposed factual scenario, if not entirely inexplicable, seems unlikely.
Sentence 13: See, e.g., United States v. Kopp, 45 F.3d 1450, 1453-54 (10th Cir.1995) (reasonable suspicion supported by the fact that officer “did not find it plausible that Defendant would drive from California to North Carolina merely to take a very dilapidated sofa to some friends”).
Sentence 14: Third, the rental agreement was of extremely short duration in light of Mr. Powell’s stated travel plans: he rented the Yukon in Colorado on May 15th, the traffic stop occurred in Kansas on the 16th, Mr. Powell stated he was driving to Kentucky to move there and start a business, and the vehicle was due back in Colorado on the 18th.
Sentence 15: Deputy Trammel testified:
Sentence 16: You know, he’s stating that he’s moving to Kentucky to start a business.
Sentence 17: There’s really no way on a three-day rental that he has, being one single driver by himself, any time at all to conduct any business, other than pretty well drive straight to Kentucky and turn around and drive straight back.
Sentence 18: I didn’t — and he also rented it both ways.
Sentence 19: Appellee’s Supp. App. at 25.
Sentence 20: The three-day rental agreement would essentially require Mr. Powell to drive the 1,190 miles from Denver to Lexington, unload the vehicle, and turn right around and drive 1,190 miles back.
Sentence 21: See Contreras, 506 F.3d at 1036 (considering “suspicious at best and incredible at worst” defendant’s claim “to have driven more than 1,200 miles to see her family, only to turn around within a day and begin the 1,200-mile drive back”).
Sentence 22: Mr. Powell argues that the rental agreement does not suggest criminal activity because it is physically possible to make the trip in that amount of time, he could have miscalculated the necessary time but later called the rental company to request an extension, or he could have chosen to be late returning the vehicle.
Sentence 23: Certainly, these are all possibilities, but under our precedent, the duration of his rental agreement, combined with the length of his trip, gives rise to a degree of suspicious conduct sufficient to contribute at least something to the reasonable suspicion calculus.
Sentence 24: Fourth, Mr. Powell was transporting a relatively small amount of luggage seemingly inconsistent with his stated purpose of moving to Kentucky.
Sentence 25: Deputy Trammel testified that, instead of looking like someone moving all of his worldly possessions, Mr. Powell’s vehicle was “probably half full,” containing only four tires, two or three boxes, a light bag, and a pillow and blanket.
Sentence 26: Appellee’s Supp. App. at 18-19.
Sentence 27: Our case law recognizes that an amount of luggage seemingly inconsistent with the stated purpose of one’s trip may fuel reasonable suspicion of involvement in illegal activity.
Sentence 28: See, e.g., United States v. Jones, 44 F.3d 860, 863, 872 (10th Cir.1995) (three small pieces of luggage in the back seat suspiciously inconsistent with alleged two-week trip); United States v. Arango, 912 F.2d 441, 443, 447 (10th Cir.1990) (two small bags inconsistent with two-week vacation for two people); United States v. Espinosa, 782 F.2d 888, 891 (10th Cir. 1986) (“very little luggage” suspicious in light of claim of being on vacation).
Sentence 29: Here, Mr. Powell told Deputy Trammel that this was his first trip and he would be making a second trip with his Suburban, and he argues on appeal that an individual may also legitimately choose to mail or ship his or her belongings for a cross-country move.
Sentence 30: But these explanations, while not implausible, do not entirely answer the question why one would make an initial cross-country trip to transport only half a vehicle of items if one plans on making a second trip and possibly shipping other items.
Sentence 31: As Deputy Trammel asked when testifying before the district court: in common experience doesn’t one usually pack things in tightly on the first trip to assure there will be room in the second trip for the remainder?
Sentence 32: Under our governing authority, an apparent (even if conceivably explicable) inconsistency between the stated purpose of a trip and the amount of luggage being transported may contribute to reasonable suspicion that illegal activity is afoot.
Sentence 33: Finally, Deputy Trammel testified that Mr. Powell appeared “excessively nervous” and remained so throughout the entire encounter, even when the deputy returned to Mr. Powell’s vehicle to let him know the deputy was only giving him a warning citation.
Sentence 34: Appellee’s Supp. App. at 15, 29-30.
Sentence 35: Mr. Powell was breathing heavily, “kept looking forward and was trying to avoid eye contact,” and offered an unprompted and extended narrative about his travel plans.
Sentence 36: Id. at 15.
Sentence 37: Of course, even law-abiding citizens exhibit signs of nervousness when confronted by a law enforcement officer, and we have repeatedly held that “nervousness is of limited significance in determining reasonable suspicion.”
Sentence 38: United States v. Wood, 106 F.3d 942, 948 (10th Cir.1997) (quoting United States v. Fernandez, 18 F.3d 874, 879 (10th Cir.1994)).
Sentence 39: But we have also held that there is “no reason ... to ignore [a defendant’s] nervousness in reviewing the totality of the circumstances,” especially when, as here, the nervousness is extreme or prolonged.
Sentence 40: Williams, 271 F.3d at 1269.
Sentence 41: Considering all of these factors together, the totality of the circumstances reveals a scenario sufficient to form a particularized and objective basis for suspecting drug trafficking and detaining Mr. Powell for further questioning about illegal drugs and a dog sniff of his vehicle.
Sentence 42: A number of orneases, holding that reasonable suspicion exists in circumstances remarkably similar to these, confirms the point.
Sentence 43: For example, in United States v. Sanchez-Valderuten, 11 F.3d 985 (10th Cir.1993), we held that the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the defendant for further questioning based on the masking smell of air freshener and coffee in his vehicle, the defendant’s apparent evasion of the officer’s questions about his point of departure, and the defendant’s seemingly unusual choice to travel 1-70 when driving from New York to Washington state.
Sentence 44: Id. at 989.
Sentence 45: Similarly, in United States v. Ledesma-Dominguez, 53 F.3d 1159 (10th Cir.1995), we held that the “[ajbsence of personal identification, appellant’s nervous behavior, and the presence of the masking odor [of ah- freshener] created ... identifiable and articulable suspicion that a drug-related crime was being committed.”
Sentence 46: Id. at 1161; see also Contreras, 506 F.3d at 1036 (holding reasonable suspicion existed based on defendant’s nervousness, her purported travel plans to drive 2,400 miles roundtrip for a one-day visit, the use of a rental car, and the presence of food wrappers from a California restaurant when the defendant claimed to be driving to Nebraska from Las Vegas).
Sentence 47: We see no convincing way to distinguish Mr. Powell’s case from these controlling precedents.
Sentence 48: Like the district court before us, we conclude that Mr. Powell’s roadside detention for further questioning and a canine sniff of his vehicle, after the initial traffic stop ended, was supported by reasonable suspicion of drug trafficking.
Sentence 49: The order of the district court is therefore affirmed.
Sentence 50: This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.
Sentence 51: It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.
Sentence 52: See United States v. Santos, 403 F.3d 1120, 1127 (10th Cir.2005) (“[U]nless [nervousness] is unusually severe or persistent, or accompanied by other, more probative, grounds for reasonable suspicion, it is of limited significance in determining whether reasonable suspicion exists.”); Williams, 271 F.3d at 1269 (including “extreme nervousness [that] did not dissipate throughout the entire stop” in reasonable suspicion analysis); see also United States v. Ozbirn, 189 F.3d 1194, 1200 (10th Cir.1999) (taking into account "suspicious conduct” such as "nervous, talkative, and overly-friendly behavior”).
Sentence 53: The government argues that Mr. Powell’s detention was lawful for another, separate reason — namely that Deputy Trammel had probable cause to arrest Mr. Powell for driving without a valid license — and cites to us by way of support United States v. Santana-Garcia, 264 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir.2001).
Sentence 54: See id. at 1192-94 (holding a detention lawful because, among other things, "probable cause to arrest arose seconds into the stop” when the officer became tiware that the defendant was driving without a license, even though the officer did not consider this to be a basis for the detention and instead relied on suspicion of drug trafficking).
Sentence 55: Whatever the merits or demerits of such an argument, the government did not raise it in the district court and we have no need to reach alternative grounds to affirm the district court’s judgment in this case.', 
Sentence 56: Dissenting/Concuring:  'Not Available',     Dissenting/Concuring 2:  'Not Available',     Dissenting/Concuring 3:  'Not Available'
