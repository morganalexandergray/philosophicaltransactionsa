TASK
In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.

-START INSTRUCTIONS-
YOU will assess sentences to and determine whether they belong to any of the following categories based on the content of the sentence and the descriptions below: 

1. Furtive Movement - Use this label if the driver or passenger in the vehicle makes a suspicious movement, such as reaching beneath a seat, or in a purse or bag, or around a waistband, or in a pocket, which is commonly an attempt to conceal contraband or a weapon.  This also includes attempting to evade custody such as taking a long time to pull the vehicle over. 
2. Nervous Behavior or Appearance - Use this label if the motorist appears to be nervous, has shaking hands or a heavy heartbeat, or is sweating even though the temperature is cool.  Also use this label if the the motorist behaves in a nervous way, avoids making eye contact with the officer, focuses on a bag or compartment in the car, appears to be agitated, confronts the officer, gives the officer a curt response, volunteers too much information, or behaves in an overly friendly way toward the officer. 
3. Suspicious or Inconsistent Answers - Use this label if the driver made an answer to an officer that is evasive, nonsensical, inconsistent, contradictory, impossible, vague, incomplete, unusual, or untruthful.
4. Motorist license or Identification - Use this label if the motorist cannot provide the officer with a license or identification or if the license is invalid, revoked, fake, the wrong color, flimsy, or in someone else’s name. 
5. Driver Status - Use this label only if the driver of the vehicle is male, young, or not from the state in which the officer pulled the car over. 
6. Refused Consent - Use this label if the driver refused to consent to the officer’s request to search the automobile.
7. Legal Indications of Drug Use - Use this label if the motorist has an active arrest warrant for a drug related charge or if the motorist has been arrested for or convicted of a drug related offense in the past or if the officer knows that the motorist has abused, possessed, dealed, or trafficked in drugs in the past. 
8. Motorist's Appearance Related to Drug Use or Sale - Use this label if driver looks like they're using drugs such as powder on a face, needle track marks, rotten teeth, scabbing, bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils, unwashed hair, dirty clothes, body odor or dirty skin or if the driver is wearing suspicious clothing, such as expensive jewelry, expensive or luxury clothing, or clothing with images of drugs (e.g., marijuana leaves).
9. Possible Drug Route - Use this label if the driver’s route is from or to a city or area, which is known for drug trafficking or high crime rates, or if the driver stops the vehicle late at night or early in the morning in an area known for criminal activity. 
10. Unusual Travel Plans - Use this label if the motorist appears to be headed to a location that the motorist has already passed, is traveling on a road that does not lead to the stated destination, plans a trip that is too far to drive in a reasonable time (e.g., driving from Philadelphia to Miami in a single night), claims to be driving a long round trip in a one-day rental vehicle, or has other unusual travel plans.
11. Expensive Vehicle - Use this label if the motorist is driving a kind of vehicle associated with illicit drug use or trafficking such as a luxury or expensive vehicle, e.g., a BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, or Range Rover.
12. Vehicle License Plate or Registration - Use this label if the vehicle's license plate is missing, shielded from view, or from out of state, or if the license plate or vehicle registration has expired.
13. Unusual Vehicle Ownership - Use this label if the vehicle is rented or if the vehicle is owned by someone not in the vehicle, unknown to the driver, or about whom the driver knows very little or claims to be a distant relative. 
14. Indicia of Hard Travel - Use this label if the motorist has been driving a great distance for a long time and is attempting to make as few stops as possible, or if the vehicle contained fast-food bags, lots of trash, energy drinks or substances designed to keep the consumer awake, such as Redbull, Five-Hour Energy, or Energize Capsules. 
15. Masking Agent - Use this label if the vehicle contained a substance or product used to mask the odor of drugs such as air fresheners (e.g., Little Trees, Febreze, Glade, etc.), scented dryer sheets or baby wipes, or strongly smelling tobacco products, cigars or cigarettes or other strong smells.
16. Vehicle Contents Suggest Drugs - Use this label if the vehicle smells of drug use (e.g., smells of raw or burnt marijuana or of chemicals such as meth or heroin) or contains drugs in plain view, or items used to ingest or use drugs such as pipes, syringes, needles, lighters, torches, drug paraphernalia, cigarette rolling papers (e.g., Raw or ZigZag brand rolling papers), marijuana cigarettes, joints, or blunts, vials, prescription bottles, or small glass containers used to hold drugs  This label also applies if there are large amounts of cash or large bill denominations (e.g., $100 bills),.
17. Suspicious Communications Device - Use this label if the officer observes suspicious communications devices such as multiple cell phones or a prepaid burner phone. 
18. Suspicious Storage - Use this label if only a small amount of luggage is visible given the stated nature of the trip, if the luggage is stored in the back of the cab instead of the trunk, if the vehicle has an unusual or secret storage compartment  or a car window that will not go down.
29. Suspicion Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect. 
20. Suspicion Not Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect.
21. No Factor - If none of the factors apply or the court is citing or quoting a legal rule, select this option.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

2. The data is in the form of an appellate court opinion.  Conclusions reached by a lower or a trial court should not be labelled.  Sample language would be "The district court concluded that the officer had probable cause for the search".

3. The charges before the court are not to be considered Legal Indications of Drug Use.  For example: "The defendant is charged with possession with intent to distribute," should not be labeled.  However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

8. Officer testimony can support the finding of a factor. 

Along with a label, you should also provide a rationale for assigning a label. Here are some examples: 

1. Sentence: Officer Guthrie testified that while the above exchanges were taking place, he noticed that the driver, Arturo Tapia, seemed nervous, and that his hands were shaking.
Label: Physical Appearance of Nervousness

2. Sentence: Upon reviewing the vehicle's documentation, Trooper Conrad discovered that the vehicle belonged to an absent third party, which, in his experience, raised his suspicion that the vehicle was being used for drug trafficking.
Label: Unusual Vehicle Ownership

3. Sentence: Typically, in my training and experience, the overwhelming smell of air fresheners in a rental vehicle is consistent with trying to mask the odor of controlled substances.
Label: Masking Agent, Unusual Vehicle Ownership

Sentence 5: Teffin Goss appeals his jury conviction of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841.
Sentence 6: Goss appeals the district court’s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained following a traffic stop, as well as the district court’s admission of evidence of Goss’s prior state drug conviction.
Sentence 7: We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm.
Sentence 8: Drug Evidence Obtained During Traffic Stop
Sentence 9: We review de novo whether a traffic stop exceeds its permissible scope.
Sentence 10: United States v. Garcia-Rivera, 353 F.3d 788, 791 (9th Cir.2003).
Sentence 11: The district court did not err in denying Goss’s motion to suppress the drug evidence obtained during Officer Keeler’s traffic stop of Goss.
Sentence 12: No Fourth Amendment violation occurs when an officer stops a driver if the officer has probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.
Sentence 13: Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996).
Sentence 14: Here, there is no debate that Officer Keeler had legitimately stopped Goss for running a red light, and thus the original detention was permissible.
Sentence 15: We focus on whether reasonable suspicion supported an extension of that stop’s scope and duration, leading to discovery of the cocaine base in Goss’s car.
Sentence 16: The scope of an officer’s stop must be tailored to the underlying justification for that stop, United States v. Chavez-Valenzuela, 268 F.3d 719, 724 (9th Cir.2001), amended by 279 F.3d 1062 (9th Cir.2002), here, running a red light.
Sentence 17: The stop must last no longer than necessary to effectuate the stop’s purpose.
Sentence 18: United States v. Mondello, 927 F.2d 1463, 1471 (9th Cir.1991).
Sentence 19: Questions prolonging the detention must be “reasonably related in scope to the justification of [the] initiation,” unless additional suspicious factors supported by reasonable suspicion justify a broadening of that scope.
Sentence 20: United States v. Mendez, 476 F.3d 1077, 1080 (9th Cir.), cert. denied,U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2277, 167 L.Ed.2d 1112 (2007).
Sentence 21: “Reasonable suspicion” requires a minimal level of objective justification, more than an inchoate or unparticularized suspicion or “hunch,” but less than probable cause.
Sentence 22: United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989).
Sentence 23: In assessing the existence of reasonable suspicion, we consider the totality of the circumstances.
Sentence 24: United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002).
Sentence 25: Goss argues that the initial stop for his traffic infraction ended when Officer Keel-er approached his vehicle with an almost complete citation for Goss’s signature or shortly thereafter and that any extension of that stop occurred without reasonable suspicion.
Sentence 26: We disagree and reject Goss’s contention that Officer Keeler prolonged the initial, valid detention beyond its origi nal scope without reasonable suspicion raised by particularized objective factors.
Sentence 27: See Chavez-Valenzuela, 268 F.3d at 724 (holding that officers may expand their initial inquiry if they notice particularized, objective factors arousing their suspicion).
Sentence 28: When Officer Keeler returned to Goss’s rental car with the nearly complete citation, he knew: that Goss was a local resident driving a rental car; that the car contained numerous, strangely placed ah\' fresheners, which might be used to mask the smell of narcotics; that the car contained a radar detector, which might be used to detect law enforcement presence; that the car was rented to a third party and Goss was not a listed driver; that Officer Keeler encountered the car on a road that drivers take when entering Fairbanks from Anchorage, a common drug-trafficking route; and that Goss had a history of some involvement related to drugs.
Sentence 29: Although each factor individually might be consistent with innocent travel, their collective presence gave rise to reasonable suspicion for Officer Keeler, particularly given his substantial law enforcement experience.
Sentence 30: See Arvizu, 534 U.S. at 274-75, 122 S.Ct. 744 (holding that Terry precludes a “divide-and-conquer analysis” and that, while each of a series of acts might be innocent in itself, taken together they warranted further investigation); United States v. Crapser, 472 F.3d 1141, 1147-48 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that under the totality of the circumstances analysis, nervousness, possession of a pressure-cooker, staying in a motel room with a person using methamphetamine and taking several minutes to open the door created reasonable suspicion); United States v. Rojas-Millan, 234 F.3d 464, 470 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that the unusually strong odor of perfume emanating from the defendant’s car, which the officer suspected was intended to mask the smell of illegal drugs, contributed to the officer’s reasonable suspicion).
Sentence 31: Considering these factors in total, Officer Keeler already had reasonable suspicion to detain Goss briefly for additional questioning and to attempt to obtain consent to search the vehicle when Officer Keeler approached Goss with citation in hand.
Sentence 32: During that questioning, then, subsequent discoveries such as Goss’s inability to recall his work phone number combined with his expensive-looking watch, and Goss’s reference to having previously been jailed, only heightened Officer Keeler’s suspicion, justifying his decision to extend the stop an additional eight minutes for a canine unit to arrive.
Sentence 33: Further, Officer Keeler diligently and quickly took measures to confirm or dispel his reasonable suspicions.
Sentence 34: See United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 685, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985) (holding that common sense and ordinary human experience govern an evaluation of whether an officer exceeded the time reasonably needed to effectuate the purposes of the investigative stop).
Sentence 35: Because reasonable suspicion supported the brief extension of the traffic stop first for additional questioning and then to wait for the canine unit, and because once the dog alerted to drugs there was probable cause to search the vehicle, the fruit of that vehicle search was admissible, and the district court correctly denied Goss’s motion to suppress the evidence.
Sentence 36: Admission of Prior Criminal History
Sentence 37: We also reject Goss’s argument that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence, during the trial, of Goss’s prior drug conviction under Federal Rules of Evidence (“FRE”) 403 and 404(b).
Sentence 38: We review for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to admit evidence of prior crimes or bad acts under FRE 404(b).
Sentence 39: United States v. Plancarte-Alvarez, 366 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir.2004).
Sentence 40: FRE 404(b) sets forth exceptions to the general inadmissibility of propensity evidence, one of which is to prove knowledge, for which the district court allowed the evidence here.
Sentence 41: For the district court to have properly admitted the evidence of Goss’s prior drug conviction, the evidence must have met four criteria: 1) it tends to prove a material fact; 2) it is sufficient to support a finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; 3) it is not too remote in time from the charged crime; and 4) the extrinsic act is similar to the crime charged.
Sentence 42: See United States v. Vizcarra-Martinez, 66 F.3d 1006, 1013 (9th Cir.1995).
Sentence 43: First, the prior case is material to the current case because knowledge was an element of the crime that the government had to prove.
Sentence 44: See United States v. Arambula-Ruiz, 987 F.2d 599, 603 (9th Cir.1993) (holding that the defendant’s prior conviction for possession of illegal drugs with intent to distribute is relevant to demonstrate knowledge, which is a material element of the crime of drug possession under 21 U.S.C. § 841).
Sentence 45: Further, the fact that the car was rented by a third party put knowledge at issue by allowing Goss to be able to claim more plausibly that he did not know there were drugs in the car.
Sentence 46: Second, Goss does not dispute that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that he committed the extrinsic act.
Sentence 47: Third, as Goss concedes, his prior conviction was not too remote in time.
Sentence 48: Fourth, to assess similarity, we determine whether “the prior act was one which would tend to make the existence of the defendant’s knowledge more probable than it would be without the evidence.”
Sentence 49: Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
Sentence 50: The similarity between the current and the pri- or incidents satisfies this test:
Sentence 51: In both instances, Goss was found in a third-party rental car containing a radar detector and air fresheners, and Goss claimed no knowledge of the drugs found in the car.
Sentence 52: In the prior case, the jury disbelieved a claim of ignorance similar to that which Goss made in this case.
Sentence 53: Evidence of this prior incident makes Goss’s knowledge of the drugs in the second third-party rental car more probable than it would have been without that evidence.
Sentence 54: Because each of the four criteria is met, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing evidence of Goss’s prior drug conviction under FRE 404(b) for the limited purpose of proving that Goss had knowledge that the vehicle contained cocaine.
Sentence 55: Finally, we reject Goss’s argument that the evidence, even if admissible under FRE 404(b) to prove knowledge, should be excluded under FRE 403 because it is more prejudicial than probative, see United States v. Lynch, 367 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam), as should be concluded where the evidence creates a tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, see United States v. Allen, 341 F.3d 870, 886 (9th Cir.2003).
Sentence 56: Here, any prejudice that the evidence may have created does not substantially outweigh the evidence’s probative value as delineated above.
Sentence 57: Further, the district court gave the jury adequate limiting instructions about the prior drug conviction evidence.
Sentence 58: AFFIRMED.
Sentence 59: This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.
Sentence 60: Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our disposition.


TASK
In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

8. Officer testimony can support the finding of a factor. 

Along with a label, you should also provide a rationale for assigning a label. Here are some examples: 

1. Sentence: Officer Guthrie testified that while the above exchanges were taking place, he noticed that the driver, Arturo Tapia, seemed nervous, and that his hands were shaking.
Label: Physical Appearance of Nervousness

2. Sentence: Upon reviewing the vehicle's documentation, Trooper Conrad discovered that the vehicle belonged to an absent third party, which, in his experience, raised his suspicion that the vehicle was being used for drug trafficking.
Label: Unusual Vehicle Ownership

3. Sentence: Typically, in my training and experience, the overwhelming smell of air fresheners in a rental vehicle is consistent with trying to mask the odor of controlled substances.
Label: Masking Agent, Unusual Vehicle Ownership

Label all of these 60 sentences: 
Label: 
Rationale: 

Sentence 1: . Goss argues that because Officer Keeler did not detect any odor coming from the air fresheners, their presence should not help to give rise to reasonable suspicion.
Sentence 2: However, their abundance and location were sufficient to contribute to Officer Keeler\'s reasonable suspicion.
Sentence 3: . Goss disputes the district court\'s finding that Officer Keeler knew that the rental car was rented to a third party.
Sentence 4: The district court’s finding, which we review for clear error, United States v. Colin, 314 F.3d 439, 442 (9th Cir.2002), is not clearly erroneous because the rental car agreement that Goss had already provided Officer Keeler on its face states that the car was rented to a person that is not Goss, and it did not list Goss as an additional driver.
Sentence 5: Officer Keeler testified that he reviewed the agreement while filling out the citation and noted that the car was not rented to Goss.
Sentence 6: . Specifically, Officer Keeler had received an "affirmative” that Goss had previous case involvement or criminal history involving drugs, i.e., "3500” history, which could have indicated anything from interrogation in a previous criminal narcotics matter to a prior felony conviction.
Sentence 7: . \' The district court found that at the time Officer Keeler decided to hold Goss for a drug sniff of the vehicle, Goss had reported having previously had police contact relating to a weapons offense.
Sentence 8: This finding is clearly erroneous; the transcript of the stop reflects that when Officer Keeler determined to detain Goss for the canine sniff, Goss had only referenced previous jail time generally; only after Officer Keeler ordered the canine unit did Goss clarify, at Officer Keeler\'s prompting, that that incident had involved a firearm.
Sentence 9: However, the district court’s error does not change our calculus that Officer Keeler had reasonable suspicion when he decided to prolong Goss\'s detention briefly for the canine unit.
Sentence 10: We reject Goss’s argument relying upon United States v. Garcia-Orozco, 997 F.2d 1302, 1304 (9th Cir.1993).
Sentence 11: In Garcia-Orozco, the defendant had previously been convicted only of resisting arrest, not of importation or possession of drugs, which the court found significant in concluding that the evidence of the drugs in the previous car—to which, the court noted, the defendant had no demonstrated connection—did not tend to prove a material point.
Sentence 12: By contrast here, in the previous incident there was such a demonstrated connection; Goss had been convicted of a drug offense in which the jury had found an adequate basis to conclude that Goss knew about the powder cocaine in the first car.', 
Sentence 13: Dissenting/Concuring:  'Not Available',     Dissenting/Concuring 2:  'Not Available',     Dissenting/Concuring 3:  'Not Available'
