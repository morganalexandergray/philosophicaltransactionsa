TASK
In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.

-START INSTRUCTIONS-
YOU will assess sentences to and determine whether they belong to any of the following categories based on the content of the sentence and the descriptions below: 

1. Furtive Movement - Use this label if the driver or passenger in the vehicle makes a suspicious movement, such as reaching beneath a seat, or in a purse or bag, or around a waistband, or in a pocket, which is commonly an attempt to conceal contraband or a weapon.  This also includes attempting to evade custody such as taking a long time to pull the vehicle over. 
2. Nervous Behavior or Appearance - Use this label if the motorist appears to be nervous, has shaking hands or a heavy heartbeat, or is sweating even though the temperature is cool.  Also use this label if the the motorist behaves in a nervous way, avoids making eye contact with the officer, focuses on a bag or compartment in the car, appears to be agitated, confronts the officer, gives the officer a curt response, volunteers too much information, or behaves in an overly friendly way toward the officer.

7. Legal Indications of Drug Use - Use this label if the motorist has an active arrest warrant for a drug related charge or if the motorist has been arrested for or convicted of a drug related offense in the past or if the officer knows that the motorist has abused, possessed, dealed, or trafficked in drugs in the past. 
8. Motorist's Appearance Related to Drug Use or Sale - Use this label if driver looks like they USE DRUGS such as needle track marks, rotten teeth, scabbing, bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils, unwashed hair, dirty clothes, body odor or dirty skin or if the driver is wearing suspicious clothing, such as expensive jewelry, expensive or luxury clothing, or clothing with images of drugs (e.g., marijuana leaves).
9. Possible Drug Route - Use this label if the driver’s route is from or to a city or area, which is known for drug trafficking or high crime rates, or if the driver stops the vehicle late at night or early in the morning in an area known for criminal activity. 
10. Unusual Travel Plans - Use this label if the motorist appears to be headed to a location that the motorist has already passed, is traveling on a road that does not lead to the stated destination, plans a trip that is too far to drive in a reasonable time (e.g., driving from Philadelphia to Miami in a single night), claims to be driving a long round trip in a one-day rental vehicle, or has other unusual travel plans.
11. Expensive Vehicle - Use this label if the motorist is driving a kind of vehicle associated with illicit drug use or trafficking such as a luxury or expensive vehicle, e.g., a BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, or Range Rover.
12. Vehicle License Plate or Registration - Use this label if the vehicle's license plate is missing, shielded from view, or from out of state, or if the license plate or vehicle registration has expired.
13. Unusual Vehicle Ownership - Use this label if the vehicle is rented or if the vehicle is owned by someone not in the vehicle, unknown to the driver, or about whom the driver knows very little or claims to be a distant relative. 
14. Indicia of Hard Travel - Use this label if the motorist has been driving a great distance for a long time and is attempting to make as few stops as possible, or if the vehicle contained fast-food bags, lots of trash, energy drinks or substances designed to keep the consumer awake, such as Redbull, Five-Hour Energy, or Energize Capsules. 
15. Masking Agent - Use this label if the vehicle contained a substance or product used to mask the odor of drugs such as air fresheners (e.g., Little Trees, Febreze, Glade, etc.), scented dryer sheets or baby wipes, or strongly smelling tobacco products, cigars or cigarettes or other strong smells.
16. Vehicle Contents Suggest Drugs - Use this label if the vehicle smells of drug use (e.g., smells of raw or burnt marijuana or of chemicals such as meth or heroin) or contains drugs in plain view, or items used to ingest or use drugs such as pipes, syringes, needles, lighters, torches, drug paraphernalia, cigarette rolling papers (e.g., Raw or ZigZag brand rolling papers), marijuana cigarettes, joints, or blunts, vials, prescription bottles, or small glass containers used to hold drugs  This label also applies if there are large amounts of cash or large bill denominations (e.g., $100 bills),.
17. Suspicious Communications Device - Use this label if the officer observes suspicious communications devices such as multiple cell phones or a prepaid burner phone. 
18. Suspicious Storage - Use this label if only a small amount of luggage is visible given the stated nature of the trip, if the luggage is stored in the back of the cab instead of the trunk, if the vehicle has an unusual or secret storage compartment  or a car window that will not go down.
29. Suspicion Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect. 
20. Suspicion Not Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect.
21. No Factor - If none of the factors apply or the court is citing or quoting a legal rule, select this option.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

2. The data is in the form of an appellate court opinion.  Conclusions reached by a lower or a trial court should not be labelled.  Sample language would be "The district court concluded that the officer had probable cause for the search".

3. The charges before the court are not to be considered Legal Indications of Drug Use.  For example: "The defendant is charged with possession with intent to distribute," should not be labeled.  However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

8. Officer testimony can support the finding of a factor. 

You should apply a label for each sentence. Here are some examples: 

1. Sentence: Officer Guthrie testified that while the above exchanges were taking place, he noticed that the driver, Arturo Tapia, seemed nervous, and that his hands were shaking.
Label: Physical Appearance of Nervousness

2. Sentence: Upon reviewing the vehicle's documentation, Trooper Conrad discovered that the vehicle belonged to an absent third party, which, in his experience, raised his suspicion that the vehicle was being used for drug trafficking.
Label: Unusual Vehicle Ownership

3. Sentence: Typically, in my training and experience, the overwhelming smell of air fresheners in a rental vehicle is consistent with trying to mask the odor of controlled substances.
Label: Masking Agent, Unusual Vehicle Ownership

Label: 

Sentence 1: Case Name:  'David Michael HILL, Appellant, v. The STATE of Texas, Appellee', 
Sentence 2: Citation:  '135 S.W.3d 267',     Court Name:  'Texas Courts of Appeals', 
Sentence 3: Decision Date YYYY-MM-DD:  '2004-04-15', 
Sentence 4: ID No. :  9238294,     'OPINION

Sentence 7: The trial court assessed punishment at ten years’ deferred adjudication probation and a $3,000 fine.
Sentence 8: In one point of error, appellant claims the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to suppress.
Sentence 9: We affirm.
Sentence 10: Background
Sentence 11: On the morning of May 24, 2001, Lawrence Lilly, Jr., a trooper with the Texas Department of Public Safety (“DPS”), stopped a vehicle on I — 10 in Chambers County for speeding and failure to signal a lane change.
Sentence 12: The vehicle had two occupants.
Sentence 13: Appellant was the driver of the vehicle.
Sentence 14: His brother, Van Hill, was the passenger.
Sentence 15: Based on appellant’s extreme nervousness and appellant’s and Van’s inconsistent stories and implausible explanation for their trip, Lilly asked for consent to search the vehicle.
Sentence 16: Appellant initially consented to a search, but later withdrew his consent.
Sentence 17: Lilly then called a canine unit to the scene, and detained appellant and Van about eight minutes past the original purpose of the traffic stop until the canine unit arrived.
Sentence 18: After the canine alerted on appellant’s vehicle, DPS found about eight pounds of marijuana in the vehicle’s trunk.
Sentence 19: Appellant does not contest the reasonableness of the original traffic stop.
Sentence 20: The question on appeal is whether Trooper Lilly had cause to detain appellant after the original purpose of the traffic stop.
Sentence 21: STANDARD OF REVIEW
Sentence 22: Once the investigation of the conduct that initiated the traffic stop was concluded, continued detention of appellant was permitted only if there was reasonable suspicion to do so.
Sentence 23: Woods v. State, 956 S.W.2d 33, 35, 38 (Tex.Crim.App.1997).
Sentence 24: To demonstrate reasonable suspicion, the State had to present to the trial court specific articulable facts, which, when combined with rational inferences from those facts, led Trooper Lilly to reasonably suspect in light of his experience and knowledge that appellant had engaged, was engaging, or was soon to engage in criminal activity.
Sentence 25: This standard is an objective one: there need only be an objective basis for the detention; the subjective intent of the trooper conducting the detention is irrelevant.
Sentence 26: Garcia v. State, 827 S.W.2d 937, 943-44 (Tex.Crim.App.1992).
Sentence 27: The reasonable suspicion determination is made by considering the totality of the circumstances.
Sentence 28: Garcia v. State, 43 S.W.3d 527, 530 (Tex.Crim.App.2001).
Sentence 29: In conducting this totality-of-the-circumstances determination, we use a bifurcated standard of review.
Sentence 30: We give almost total deference to the trial court’s determination of historical facts supported by the record and the application of law to fact questions that turn on credibility and demeanor, however, we review de novo application of law to fact questions that do not turn upon credibility and demeanor.
Sentence 31: Carmouche v. State, 10 S.W.3d 323, 327 (Tex.Crim.App.2000); Guzman v. State, 955 S.W.2d 85, 89 (Tex.Crim.App.1997).
Sentence 32: Accordingly, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the trial court’s ruling, and sustain the ruling if it is sufficiently supported by the evidence and is correct on any theory of law applicable to the case.
Sentence 33: Villarreal v. State, 935 S.W.2d 134, 138 (Tex.Crim.App.1996).
Sentence 34: Discussion
Sentence 35: At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the State introduced the testimony of Trooper Lilly and Trooper Ted Smith, a canine handler with DPS.
Sentence 36: The traffic stop and search of appellant’s vehicle was videotaped by a camera mounted in Lilly’s patrol vehicle.
Sentence 37: The videotape was also admitted into evidence by the State, and we have reviewed it as a part of our review of the record.
Sentence 38: Trooper Lilly, who had been working with DPS for six years as of the date of the hearing, testified that when he pulled appellant over on May 24, 2001, his intent was to write appellant citations for the two driving violations.
Sentence 39: After Lilly asked appellant to step in front of the patrol car, appellant’s hands shook tremendously when he handed his driver’s license over to the trooper.
Sentence 40: Appellant hesitated when asked about where he had come from that morning, but then responded “Pasadena.”
Sentence 41: Appellant told Lilly he and Van had come from Florida to the Houston area to buy a truck because they could get one a lot cheaper in Houston.
Sentence 42: They had driven from Florida, had spent one day in Houston, and were headed back to Florida.
Sentence 43: Appellant told Lilly that they had found a couple of trucks.
Sentence 44: Lilly thought it implausible that someone would drive from Florida to spend just one day in Houston to shop for a truck.
Sentence 45: Appellant said he thought they had spent the night at the Pasadena Inn. Appellant initially told Lilly that a friend of “ours” had loaned him the car for the trip, but when he could not recall the last name of the car’s owner, appellant said that the owner was actually a friend of Van. Lilly thought it was odd that appellant was driving a car, but did not know the last name of the car’s owner.
Sentence 46: Appellant was very fidgety and fiddled with a piece of paper the whole time he spoke with the trooper.
Sentence 47: Lilly then walked over to Van, who had remained seated in the vehicle.
Sentence 48: When he approached the vehicle, Van started looking at a magazine, and never looked up from it — he made no eye contact with Lilly.
Sentence 49: Van said he thought they were coming from Pasadena and had been there looking for trucks.
Sentence 50: Van said he did not know if they had found any trucks yet because they were still looking.
Sentence 51: Van said he thought they had stayed at the Pasadena Motor Inn the previous night.
Sentence 52: When asked where they were going, Van said they were going to Baytown, Beaumont, and all around the area.

Sentence 56: Lilly noticed that while he was questioning Van, appellant paced back and forth nervously.
Sentence 57: Trooper Lilly then went back over to appellant.
Sentence 58: He asked appellant if he and Van were headed back home, and appellant responded that they were going to stop in Beaumont.
Sentence 59: When Lilly asked for consent to search the vehicle, appellant looked back at the vehicle twice and seemed unsure how to answer.
Sentence 60: Appellant initially consented to the search, but sensing hesitation on appellant’s part, Lilly informed appellant that he did not have to consent to a search.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

Label all of these 60 sentences: 
Label: 

Sentence 1: Appellant then withdrew his consent.
Sentence 2: Lilly went to his patrol car and called the canine unit, but it did not respond.
Sentence 3: He contacted dispatch to run the driver’s license numbers of appellant and Van. Lilly then made contact with the canine unit, which arrived approximately eight minutes after dispatch notified Lilly that appellant and Van did not have any outstanding warrants.
Sentence 4: Appellant contends the videotape contradicts the testimony of Trooper Lilly.
Sentence 5: Specifically, appellant argues that on the videotape (1) neither his hands nor voice appear to shake; (2) he does not hesitate when asked where he was coming from; (3) he uses “trucks” in the plural and Van uses “truck” in the singular; (4)
Sentence 6: Van asks if he needed to get out of the car; and (5) he was not pacing nervously.
Sentence 7: After viewing the videotape, we conclude the events as captured by the camera do not undermine Lilly’s testimony at the suppression hearing.
Sentence 8: Due to the very poor quality of the videotape, it is impossible to determine whether appellant’s hands were shaking during the traffic stop.
Sentence 9: Moreover, appellant’s hands are somewhat obstructed because of where Trooper Lilly was standing.
Sentence 10: It is also unclear whether appellant hesitates when asked from where he was coming.
Sentence 11: Appellant makes a response to Trooper Lilly directly following the question, but his response is inaudible due to traffic noise.
Sentence 12: When the noise subsides somewhat, appellant says “Pasadena.”
Sentence 13: On the tape, it is appellant who uses “trucks” and Van who uses “truck.”
Sentence 14: However, Lilly’s conclusion that appellant and Van made inconsistent statements about the purpose of their trip is not undermined because he incorrectly recalled which one of the vehicle’s occupants used the singular rather than the plural.
Sentence 15: Van does ask Trooper Lilly if he needs to get out of the vehicle, but this fact does not contradict Trooper Lilly’s testimony that Van made no eye contact with him and stated that he could not find his driver’s license although Lilly saw him flip past it while they were talking.
Sentence 16: Appellant does pace in place and back and forth in front of the patrol car while Trooper Lilly was speaking with Van.
Sentence 17: We disagree with appellant’s contention that his movement was minimal.
Sentence 18: The videotape also shows that appellant looked back at the vehicle three times (not two times) when Trooper Lilly asked for consent to search.
Sentence 19: Moreover, the videotape captured remarks Lilly made to the canine handler when he arrived at the scene: “Stories....
Sentence 20: This guy’s so nervous ...
Sentence 21: I wonder if he’s going to pass out.”
Sentence 22: These comments further support the testimony of Trooper Lilly that the level of nervousness he was observing was not the typical amount of nervousness exhibited during a traffic stop.
Sentence 23: Trooper Lilly testified to many facts that developed a reasonable suspicion in his mind that appellant was engaging or was soon to engage in criminal activity.
Sentence 24: See id.
Sentence 25: An officer is entitled to rely on all of the information obtained during the course of his contact with a suspect in developing articulable facts that would justify a continued investigatory detention.
Sentence 26: Razo v. State, 577 S.W.2d 709, 711 (Tex.Crim.App. [Panel Op.] 1979).
Sentence 27: Trooper Lilly said that (1) he thought it was odd that appellant, who was driving, did not know the last name of the vehicle’s owner; (2) appellant and Van were not consistent with regard to the number of trucks they planned to purchase or about the specific plans for the day of the traffic stop; (3) he thought it was implausible that someone would make a one-day trip from Florida to Houston to purchase a truck (or trucks); (4) appellant exhibited an extreme level of nervousness; (5)
Sentence 28: Van made no eye contract at all with him; and (6)
Sentence 29: Van said he could not find his driver’s license even though Lilly saw him flip past it while they were talking.
Sentence 30: It is not important that any of these facts when viewed alone may appear purely innocent or may not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion.
Sentence 31: See Telshow v. State, 964 S.W.2d 303, 306 (TexApp.-Houston [14th Disk] 1998, no pet.) (stating that “there may be instances when a person’s conduct, viewed in a vacuum, appears purely innocent, yet when viewed in the light of the totality of the circumstances, those actions give rise to reasonable suspicion”).
Sentence 32: Additionally, we note that, although reasonable suspicion must be based on articulable facts rather than an unpar-tieularized hunch, the level of suspicion required for a detention “is obviously less demanding than that for probable cause” and probable cause only requires “ ‘a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found.’ ”
Sentence 33: United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)) (“The Fourth Amendment requires ‘some minimal level of objective justification’ [for a detention] considerably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence.”) (quoting INS v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210, 217, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984)).
Sentence 34: Based on our review of the totality of the circumstances, in light of the trooper’s experience and knowledge, we find Trooper Lilly corroborated enough facts to justify detention of appellant until the canine unit arrived at the scene.
Sentence 35: We overrule appellant’s sole point of error, and affirm the trial court’s judgment.
Sentence 36: . Trooper Lilly testified the videotape accurately reflects the traffic stop, but noted that, because of the videotape’s poor quality, it does not completely capture the level of appellant’s nervousness, such as the shaking of appellant’s hands.
Sentence 37: . Appellant relies on United States v. Dortch, 199 F.3d 193 (1999), and Davis v. State, 947 S.W.2d 240 (Tex.Crim.App.1997).
Sentence 38: The cases are distinguishable because in both cases the officers indicated to the defendants that they were free to leave the scene, but that their vehicles were being detained.
Sentence 39: Dortch, 199 F.3d at 196; Davis, 947 S.W.2d at 241.
Sentence 40: The courts in boffi cases found the instruction to each defendant that he could leave seriously undercut a finding of reasonable suspicion.
Sentence 41: Dortch, 199 F.3d at 199 (stating that, because the defendant remained at scene sifter he was told he could leave, the police could not rely on their assertion that the defendant appeared "as if he was looking for a place to run”); Davis, 947 S.W.2d at 241 (“Indeed, when viewed in an objective fashion, no known fact, or rational inferences from those facts, would support the conclusion that appellant was engaged in or soon would engage in criminal activity.
Sentence 42: The officers obviously made the same determination because they informed appellant that he was free to leave.”) (citations omitted).',
