TASK
In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.

-START INSTRUCTIONS-
YOU will assess sentences to and determine whether they belong to any of the following categories based on the content of the sentence and the descriptions below: 

1. Furtive Movement - Use this label if the driver or passenger in the vehicle makes a suspicious movement, such as reaching beneath a seat, or in a purse or bag, or around a waistband, or in a pocket, which is commonly an attempt to conceal contraband or a weapon.  This also includes attempting to evade custody such as taking a long time to pull the vehicle over. 
2. Nervous Behavior or Appearance - Use this label if the motorist appears to be nervous, has shaking hands or a heavy heartbeat, or is sweating even though the temperature is cool.

14. Indicia of Hard Travel - Use this label if the motorist has been driving a great distance for a long time and is attempting to make as few stops as possible, or if the vehicle contained fast-food bags, lots of trash, energy drinks or substances designed to keep the consumer awake, such as Redbull, Five-Hour Energy, or Energize Capsules. 
15. Masking Agent - Use this label if the vehicle contained a substance or product used to mask the odor of drugs such as air fresheners (e.g., Little Trees, Febreze, Glade, etc.), scented dryer sheets or baby wipes, or strongly smelling tobacco products, cigars or cigarettes or other strong smells.
16. Vehicle Contents Suggest Drugs - Use this label if the vehicle smells of drug use (e.g., smells of raw or burnt marijuana or of chemicals such as meth or heroin) or contains drugs in plain view, or items used to ingest or use drugs such as pipes, syringes, needles, lighters, torches, drug paraphernalia, cigarette rolling papers (e.g., Raw or ZigZag brand rolling papers), marijuana cigarettes, joints, or blunts, vials, prescription bottles, or small glass containers used to hold drugs  This label also applies if there are large amounts of cash or large bill denominations (e.g., $100 bills),.

18. Suspicious Storage - Use this label if only a small amount of luggage is visible given the stated nature of the trip, if the luggage is stored in the back of the cab instead of the trunk, if the vehicle has an unusual or secret storage compartment  or a car window that will not go down.
29. Suspicion Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect. 
20. Suspicion Not Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect.
21. No Factor - If none of the factors apply or the court is citing or quoting a legal rule, select this option.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

2. The data is in the form of an appellate court opinion.  Conclusions reached by a lower or a trial court should not be labelled.  Sample language would be "The district court concluded that the officer had probable cause for the search".

3. The charges before the court are not to be considered Legal Indications of Drug Use.  For example: "The defendant is charged with possession with intent to distribute," should not be labeled.  However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

8. Officer testimony can support the finding of a factor. 

You should apply a label for each sentence. Here are some examples: 

1. Sentence: Officer Guthrie testified that while the above exchanges were taking place, he noticed that the driver, Arturo Tapia, seemed nervous, and that his hands were shaking.
Label: Physical Appearance of Nervousness

2. Sentence: Upon reviewing the vehicle's documentation, Trooper Conrad discovered that the vehicle belonged to an absent third party, which, in his experience, raised his suspicion that the vehicle was being used for drug trafficking.
Label: Unusual Vehicle Ownership

3. Sentence: Typically, in my training and experience, the overwhelming smell of air fresheners in a rental vehicle is consistent with trying to mask the odor of controlled substances.
Label: Masking Agent, Unusual Vehicle Ownership

Label all of these 60 sentences: 
Label: 

Sentence 1: Case Name:  'Jose AYALA v. STATE of Arkansas', 
Sentence 2: Citation:  '90 Ark. App. 13',     Court Name:  'Arkansas Court of Appeals', 
Sentence 3: Decision Date YYYY-MM-DD:  '2005-02-16', 
Sentence 4: ID No. :  6136262,     'ohn B. Robbins, Judge.
Sentence 5: Appellant Jose Ayala was convicted by a jury of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver.
Sentence 6: He was sentenced to twenty-four years in prison and fined $75,000.00.
Sentence 7: Mr. Ayala’s sole point on appeal is that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to suppress the marijuana seized by the police.
Sentence 8: He contends that the search of his vehicle was unreasonable, and thus violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution as well as Article 2, § 15 of the Arkansas Constitution.
Sentence 9: We find no error and affirm.
Sentence 10: Officer Jeff Smith testified for the State at the suppression hearing.
Sentence 11: He stated that he is a canine officer and was patrolling Interstate 40 in Crawford County at about 9:00 a.m. on August 11, 2002.
Sentence 12: Officer Smith was parked on the side of the highway and observed a Chevy S10 Blazer, which was being driven by Mr. Ayala, traveling sixty-six miles per hour in a sixty-mile-per-hour construction zone.
Sentence 13: Officer Smith decided to follow the vehicle, and while he was following he received information that the vehicle had been rented in California.
Sentence 14: About five miles from where he observed the speeding violation, Officer Smith conducted a traffic stop.
Sentence 15: He approached the vehicle and spoke with Mr. Ayala from the passenger side.
Sentence 16: According to Officer Smith, he could smell a strong odor of what appeared to be fabric softener sheets coming from the vehicle, and he testified that this raised his suspicion that narcotics were being masked.
Sentence 17: Officer Smith testified that Mr. Ayala was nervous and shaking, and that he almost dropped his paperwork when he was asked to provide it.
Sentence 18: Mr. Ayala told Officer Smith that he was headed to Tennessee and then Florida.
Sentence 19: Officer Smith noticed a very large suitcase in the back of the Blazer, and he returned to his patrol car with Mr. Ayala’s paperwork.
Sentence 20: While in his patrol unit, Officer Smith found that Mr. Ayala’s driver’s license was valid and that “everything was in order.”
Sentence 21: The rental agreement showed that the vehicle was rented on August 9, 2002, and was due back in Los Angeles on August 13, 2002, at 1:30 p.m. Officer Smith thought it suspicious that Mr. Ayala was driving to Florida, yet the rental car was due to be returned in California in just two days, so he called for backup.
Sentence 22: After the backup officer arrived, Officer Smith again approached the Blazer and asked Mr. Ayala to exit to the rear of the vehicle.
Sentence 23: Mr. Ayala complied, and while still holding his paperwork, Officer Smith asked if there were any drugs in the vehicle.
Sentence 24: Mr. Ayala then invited Officer Smith to conduct a search, nodding his head in the direction of the truck and stating, “if you would like to check.”
Sentence 25: At that time, Officer Smith did not immediately search the vehicle but ran his canine around it.
Sentence 26: The dog alerted to drugs by biting and scratching at the door seam on the driver side.
Sentence 27: Officer Smith then opened the car door and opened the suitcase, and found 273 pounds of marijuana.
Sentence 28: Mr. Ayala testified on his own behalf, and denied being nervous.
Sentence 29: Mr. Ayala testified:
Sentence 30: I remember he asked me if there was any drugs after he ran the dog through.
Sentence 31: Like he said, for me to tell him; otherwise, he was going to search for himself.
Sentence 32: What I’m saying is he ran the dog around the car and then he asked me if there were any drags or narcotics in the car.
Sentence 33: Then he asked me if he could search the car.
Sentence 34: When he asked me that, I recall saying, you gotta do what you gotta do.
Sentence 35: A video/audio tape taken from the patrol car showed that, in fact, Mr. Ayala invited Officer Smith to search the vehicle before the canine was used.
Sentence 36: For reversal, Mr. Ayala argues that the marijuana should have been suppressed because the search was illegal.
Sentence 37: Mr. Ayala does not challenge the legality of the stop, but contends that after Officer Smith finished checking his paperwork and the purpose of the stop was complete, he lacked authority to continue the detention.
Sentence 38: Mr. Ayala cites United States v. Mesa, 62 F.3d 159 (6th Cir. 1995), where the appeals court held that once the purpose of a traffic stop is completed, the police officer cannot further detain the vehicle or its occupants unless something that occurred during the traffic stop generated reasonable suspicion to justify further detention.
Sentence 39: Mr. Ayala also cites United States v. Lee, 73 F.3d 1034 (10th Cir. 1996), where the appeals court held that an encounter initiated by a traffic stop may not be deemed consensual unless the driver’s documents have been returned to him.
Sentence 40: Mr. Ayala contends that, absent any reasonable suspicion of other criminal activity, Officer Smith was obligated to return the paperwork and Mr. Ayala should have been free to leave.
Sentence 41: Because the consent and canine sniff occurred at a time after further detention was unlawful, Mr. Ayala argues that the marijuana was illegally detected and seized.
Sentence 42: Mr. Ayala further submits that admission of the marijuana could not be based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity by Officer Smith, because there was none.
Sentence 43: He asserts that his nervousness and the rental agreement did not give rise to any reasonable cause, and further contends that we cannot consider Officer Smith’s testimony about the odor of fabric softener.
Sentence 44: Mr. Ayala notes that the audio tape reveals statements by Officer Smith about Mr. Ayala’s nervousness, and the officer’s suspicions regarding the rental agreement, but contains no statements making reference to fabric softener.
Sentence 45: Thus, Mr. Ayala maintains that Officer Smith did not find the fabric softener until he searched the suitcase.
Sentence 46: We agree with Mr. Ayala’s argument that, absent reasonable suspicion, Officer Smith lacked authority to continue his detention after he checked Mr. Ayala’s paperwork and the purpose of the stop had been completed.
Sentence 47: In this regard, we are guided by our supreme court’s recent decision in Sims v. State, 356 Ark. 507, 157 S.W.3d 530 (2004).
Sentence 48: In that case, the appellant was stopped for a moving violation, and after the officer returned appellant’s identification information, appellant began walking back to his vehicle and the officer then asked for consent to search.
Sentence 49: The appellant refused, but the officer held appellant long enough to conduct a canine sniff.
Sentence 50: The dog alerted, and drugs were found.
Sentence 51: The supreme court reversed the denial of appellant’s motion to suppress, citing United States v. Mesa, supra, and holding that because the purpose of the traffic stop was complete, the officer’s continued detention was unlawful absent reasonable suspicion, and no reasonable suspicion existed.
Sentence 52: The State argues that the instant case is distinguishable from Sims v. State, supra, because Officer Smith did not return the paperwork and tell Mr. Ayala he was free to leave.
Sentence 53: However, we cannot agree with this distinction because it is evident that the purpose of the traffic stop was completed, and thus absent any reasonable suspicion it was the officer’s duty to return the paperwork, issue a citation or warning if necessary, and discontinue the detention.
Sentence 54: We distinguish this case from Illinois v. Caballes,_ U.S._(Jan. 24, 2005), in which the use of a narcotics-detection dog during a traffic stop was upheld.
Sentence 55: In Caballes the canine was walked around appellant’s vehicle by one officer while the other officer was in the process of writing the appellant a warning ticket.
Sentence 56: Nor do we agree that, in the absence of reasonable suspicion, Mr. Ayala’s consent validated the search.
Sentence 57: This is because, after the purpose of the traffic stop was complete, the ensuing encounter was not consensual.
Sentence 58: See United States v. Sandoval, 29 F.3d 537 (10th Cir. 1994).
Sentence 59: Notwithstanding the fact that the continued detention of Mr. Ayala was not consensual, we hold that it was nonetheless authorized because Officer Smith had reasonable suspicion that Mr. Ayala was committing a felony.
Sentence 60: Arkansas Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.1 provides:

TASK
In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

2. The data is in the form of an appellate court opinion.  Conclusions reached by a lower or a trial court should not be labelled.  Sample language would be "The district court concluded that the officer had probable cause for the search".

However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

8. Officer testimony can support the finding of a factor. 

You should apply a label for each sentence. Here are some examples: 

1. Sentence: Officer Guthrie testified that while the above exchanges were taking place, he noticed that the driver, Arturo Tapia, seemed nervous, and that his hands were shaking.
Label: Physical Appearance of Nervousness

2. Sentence: Upon reviewing the vehicle's documentation, Trooper Conrad discovered that the vehicle belonged to an absent third party, which, in his experience, raised his suspicion that the vehicle was being used for drug trafficking.

Label all of these 60 sentences: 
Label: 

Sentence 1: A law enforcement officer lawfully present in any place may, in the performance of his duties, stop and detain any person who he reasonably suspects is committing, has committed, or is about to commit (1) a felony, or (2) a misdemeanor involving danger of forcible injury to persons or of appropriation of or damage to property, if such action is reasonably necessary either to obtain or verify the identification of the person or to determine the lawfulness of his conduct.
Sentence 2: An officer acting under this rule may require the person to remain in or near such place in he officer’s presence for a period of not more than fifteen (15) minutes or for such time as is reasonable under the circumstances.
Sentence 3: At the end of such period the person detained shall be released without further restraint, or arrested and charged with an offense.
Sentence 4: Rule 2.1 defines “reasonable suspicion” as “a suspicion based on facts or circumstances which of themselves do not give rise to the probable cause requisite to justify a lawful arrest, but which give rise to more than a bare suspicion; that is, a suspicion that is reasonable as opposed to an imaginary or purely conjectural suspicion.”
Sentence 5: Officer Smith testified that Mr. Ayala was very nervous to the point where he was shaking and almost dropped his paperwork.
Sentence 6: While nervousness alone cannot constitute reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and grounds for detention, see Laime v. State, 347 Ark. 142, 60 S.W.3d 464 (2001), there were other factors that when combined with Mr. Ayala’s nervousness gave rise to reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.
Sentence 7: Mr. Ayala represented that he was traveling to Florida to visit family, and yet his rental car was due back in Los Angeles in just two days.
Sentence 8: Unusual travel plans may provide an indicia of reasonable suspicion.
Sentence 9: See United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1 (1989).
Sentence 10: Moreover, Officer Smith testified that he smelled a strong odor of fabric softener.
Sentence 11: The presence of a masking odor has been held to constitute a factor in determining reasonable cause.
Sentence 12: See United States v. Foley, 206 F.3d 802 (8th Cir.2000).
Sentence 13: While Mr. Ayala submits that the trial court could not consider the odor of fabric softener as a factor because it was not articulated on the audio tape, this is incorrect because Officer Smith testified that he immediately detected the odor upon approaching the vehicle, and it was the trial court’s duty to assess witness credibility.
Sentence 14: See Scott v. State, 347 Ark. 767, 67 S.W.3d 567 (2002).
Sentence 15: Finally, the presence of a very large suitcase was suspicious in light of a car-rental agreement lasting only four days.
Sentence 16: We acknowledge that, in a somewhat similar case, we recently reversed a trial court’s denial of a motion to suppress because the officer lacked reasonable suspicion to continue the detention after a traffic stop was complete.
Sentence 17: See Lilley v. State, 89 Ark. App. 43, 199 S.W.3d 692 (2004) (currently under review by the Arkansas Supreme Court).
Sentence 18: However the case at bar is distinguishable for two reasons.
Sentence 19: First, the officer in the instant case detected a strong odor of fabric sheets, as opposed to air freshener, and testified that about seventy-five percent of the controlled substances he has seized on 1-40 were masked with fabric sheets.
Sentence 20: Next, the travel plans and rental agreement were much more suspicious in this case than in Lilley v. State, supra.
Sentence 21: In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we conduct a de novo review based on the totality of the circumstances, reviewing findings of historical facts for clear error and determining whether those facts give rise to reasonable suspicion or probable cause, giving due weight to inferences drawn by the trial court.
Sentence 22: Simmons v. State, 83 Ark. App. 87, 118 S.W.3d 136 (2003).
Sentence 23: Based on our review of the totality of the circumstances in this case, we hold that the trial court committed no error in finding that Officer Smith had reasonable suspicion to continue his detention of Mr. Ayala, and that the marijuana was legally seized because it was the result of consent and a canine sniff that occurred during the lawful detention.
Sentence 24: Therefore, we affirm Mr. Ayala’s conviction.
Sentence 25: Affirmed.
Sentence 26: Gladwin, J., agrees.
Sentence 27: Neal, J., concurs.', 
Sentence 28: Dissenting/Concuring:  'Not Available',     Dissenting/Concuring 2:  'Not Available',     Dissenting/Concuring 3:  'Not Available'
