TASK
In this task, we are attempting to label sentences to assess whether they contain important information.  These facts are tied to a specific legal problem which we have described below: 

-START LEGAL PROBLEM EXPLANATION-
We are interested in highway drug-interdiction. This occurs when a motorist is stopped by police for violating a traffic law and is subsequently detained based on an officer’s reasonable suspicion that the motorist is trafficking or possessing drugs.
An example of drug interdiction: John Smith, a motorist, is driving down interstate 95 in Miami Dade County, Florida with a brake light out and an occluded license plate. Officer Brown, who has been following Mr. Smith, initiates a traffic stop due to the light and the license plate. After Mr. Smith pulls over, Officer Brown observes Mr. Smith is moving around and appears to be reaching under his seat. After approaching the vehicle, Officer Brown notices that Mr. Smith is more nervous that someone would usually be when stopped for a traffic offense. He notices that Mr. Smith is sweating, shaking, and avoiding eye contact. Mr. Smith hands Officer Brown his license and registration, and vehicle rental agreement, which shows that Mr. Smith rented the vehicle in Philadelphia, and the car is due back there in 1 day. Officer Brown notices two cellphones in the center console, 1 prepaid, and 1 iPhone; he sees numerous cans of Redbull, and McDonald’s bags strewn about the vehicle; he notices a number of air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror; he sees that instead of placing his luggage in the trunk, Mr. Smith has kept a small amount of luggage in the rear of the vehicle. Officer Brown asks Mr. Smith where he is coming from and where he is going. Mr. Smith states that he is coming from Washington D.C. and is headed to Arkansas to see family. When Officer Smith asks why, if he was headed to Arkansas to see family, he was in Miami, Mr. Smith states that he is actually seeing his girlfriend, who he cannot name, in Miami, before heading west to Arkansas to see his family. Based on the foregoing, Officer Brown believes that Mr. Smith is actually trafficking drugs, and detains him for 20 minutes until a drug dog can complete an open air sniff of the vehicle. Upon completion of the sniff, the dog indicates that there are drugs in the trunk of the vehicle. After opening the trunk, Officer Brown seizes 5kg of cocaine from the vehicle. Mr. Smith is arrested, and subsequently charged.
The legal question presented from these facts is whether Officer Brown had reasonable suspicion based upon articulable facts (his observations) that criminal activity was afoot. If so, then he could detain Mr. Smith for the time necessary to complete a canine sniff of the vehicle. If not, Mr. Smith’s constitutional rights have been violated due to the detention. We will be annotating cases that present the same legal problem. Although the facts (factors) of each case will be different to some degree (small or great), this is the legal problem that must be examined. There are certain kinds of facts that we are interested in identifying. Below we refer to these facts as factors.

-START INSTRUCTIONS-
YOU will assess sentences to and determine whether they belong to any of the following categories based on the content of the sentence and the descriptions below: 

1. Furtive Movement - Use this label if the driver or passenger in the vehicle makes a suspicious movement, such as reaching beneath a seat, or in a purse or bag, or around a waistband, or in a pocket, which is commonly an attempt to conceal contraband or a weapon.  This also includes attempting to evade custody such as taking a long time to pull the vehicle over. 
2. Nervous Behavior or Appearance - Use this label if the motorist appears to be nervous, has shaking hands or a heavy heartbeat, or is sweating even though the temperature is cool.

Motorist's Appearance Related to Drug Use or Sale - Use this label if driver looks like they USE DRUGS such as needle track marks, rotten teeth, scabbing, bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils, unwashed hair, dirty clothes, body odor or dirty skin or if the driver is wearing suspicious clothing, such as expensive jewelry, expensive or luxury clothing, or clothing with images of drugs (e.g., marijuana leaves).
9. Possible Drug Route - Use this label if the driver’s route is from or to a city or area, which is known for drug trafficking or high crime rates, or if the driver stops the vehicle late at night or early in the morning in an area known for criminal activity. 
10. Unusual Travel Plans - Use this label if the motorist appears to be headed to a location that the motorist has already passed, is traveling on a road that does not lead to the stated destination, plans a trip that is too far to drive in a reasonable time (e.g., driving from Philadelphia to Miami in a single night), claims to be driving a long round trip in a one-day rental vehicle, or has other unusual travel plans.
11. Expensive Vehicle - Use this label if the motorist is driving a kind of vehicle associated with illicit drug use or trafficking such as a luxury or expensive vehicle, e.g., a BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, or Range Rover.

14. Indicia of Hard Travel - Use this label if the motorist has been driving a great distance for a long time and is attempting to make as few stops as possible, or if the vehicle contained fast-food bags, lots of trash, energy drinks or substances designed to keep the consumer awake, such as Redbull, Five-Hour Energy, or Energize Capsules. 
15. Masking Agent - Use this label if the vehicle contained a substance or product used to mask the odor of drugs such as air fresheners (e.g., Little Trees, Febreze, Glade, etc.), scented dryer sheets or baby wipes, or strongly smelling tobacco products, cigars or cigarettes or other strong smells.
16. Vehicle Contents Suggest Drugs - Use this label if the vehicle smells of drug use (e.g., smells of raw or burnt marijuana or of chemicals such as meth or heroin) or contains drugs in plain view, or items used to ingest or use drugs such as pipes, syringes, needles, lighters, torches, drug paraphernalia, cigarette rolling papers (e.g., Raw or ZigZag brand rolling papers), marijuana cigarettes, joints, or blunts, vials, prescription bottles, or small glass containers used to hold drugs  This label also applies if there are large amounts of cash or large bill denominations (e.g., $100 bills),.

20. Suspicion Not Found - Use this label if the court deciding the case concludes, based on the facts present in the case, that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to detain the suspect.
21. No Factor - If none of the factors apply or the court is citing or quoting a legal rule, select this option.

You are also to follow these specific rules:

Typically, a sentence will describe a single factor, however, in some cases, a single sentence may include more than one factor.  If a sentence describes more than one factor, give a label for each factor in the sentence. 

Here are some specific rules you should follow:

1. Precepts or rules of law described by the court should not be labelled.  For example: "A police officer may extend the detention beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop if the driver consents or the officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Id. at 336."

2. The data is in the form of an appellate court opinion.  Conclusions reached by a lower or a trial court should not be labelled.  Sample language would be "The district court concluded that the officer had probable cause for the search".

3. The charges before the court are not to be considered Legal Indications of Drug Use.  For example: "The defendant is charged with possession with intent to distribute," should not be labeled.  However, "A record check revealed that the motorist had a conviction for drug possession" should be labelled as Legal Indication of Drug Use.

4. A sentence may be from a concurring or dissenting opinion. Do not annotate concurring or dissenting opinions even if they contain sentences describing factors.

5. Arguments by the parties should never be treated as a factor.  For example: "Gray argues that there was not reasonable suspicion for a prolonged detention".  Because this describes an argument, it is not a fact. Common words for argument are challenges, maintains, proffers, alleges. 

6. Sentences that contain solely a legal citation should be labelled as No Factor.  For example: "United States v. Oliver, 343 U.S. 900 (2019)"

7. Statements that describe a legal issue are not a factor.  For example: "The question before the court is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain the motorist?"

8. Officer testimony can support the finding of a factor. 

You should apply a label for each sentence. Here are some examples: 

1. Sentence: Officer Guthrie testified that while the above exchanges were taking place, he noticed that the driver, Arturo Tapia, seemed nervous, and that his hands were shaking.
Label: Physical Appearance of Nervousness

2. Sentence: Upon reviewing the vehicle's documentation, Trooper Conrad discovered that the vehicle belonged to an absent third party, which, in his experience, raised his suspicion that the vehicle was being used for drug trafficking.
Label: Unusual Vehicle Ownership

3. Sentence: Typically, in my training and experience, the overwhelming smell of air fresheners in a rental vehicle is consistent with trying to mask the odor of controlled substances.
Label: Masking Agent, Unusual Vehicle Ownership

Sentence 41: Although Binion asserts there was not probable cause for his traffic stop, he does not contest that the speed limit in the area was 45 miles per hour nor that Montgomery was driving in excess of that speed.
Sentence 42: Any traffic violation creates probable cause to stop a vehicle, and Beck had an objectively reasonable belief that Montgomery was speeding.
Sentence 43: See United States v. Sallis, 507 F.3d 646, 649 (8th Cir.2007).
Sentence 44: The district court found Beck’s explanation for why she stopped the car to be credible, and such assessments are “virtually unassailable on appeal.”
Sentence 45: United States v. Rodriguez, 414 F.3d 837, 845 (8th Cir.2005).
Sentence 46: Binion charges nevertheless that Beck’s explanation for why she stopped the car is not credible because she could not say on cross examination what percentage of Interstate 80 in Illinois has a speed limit of 65 miles per hour.
Sentence 47: That question is irrelevant to the issue of probable cause since the car was admittedly stopped in a 45 mile zone.
Sentence 48: Also of little effect were Bin-ion’s efforts to impeach Beck by arguing that she could not have observed the driver hiding something under the seat from her vantage point and that she failed to detect the crack cocaine in his front pocket when she frisked him.
Sentence 49: Binion further contends that Beck violated the Fourth Amendment by expanding her investigation beyond the scope of the traffic stop and detaining him.
Sentence 50: An officer may question a person if she has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the person is engaged in criminal activity.
Sentence 51: See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); United States v. Long, 320 F.3d 795, 800 (8th Cir.2003) (investigative detention “can grow out of a traffic stop so long as the officer has reasonable suspicion to expand his investigation”).
Sentence 52: The officer must have a “particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity” in light of all the circumstances from which “a trained officer draws inferences and makes deductions ... that might well elude an untrained person.”
Sentence 53: United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981).
Sentence 54: Beck, who had thirteen years of experience as a highway patrol officer, explained that she was suspicious that Binion was involved in criminal activity because of the strong odor of marijuana emanating from the car and his person, as well as his lethargy, nervousness, and shakiness.
Sentence 55: See United States v. Caves, 890 F.2d 87, 90 (8th Cir.1989) (smell of burnt marijuana created probable cause for vehicle search).
Sentence 56: Binion argues that the odor could be explained by the fact that he was sitting in a car in which others had been smoking and that Beck “had no baseline against which to evaluate [his] level of functioning.”
Sentence 57: Even if Binion’s individual actions “could be susceptible to innocent explanation, [his] behavior must be considered as a whole and in the light of the officers’ experience and specialized training.”
Sentence 58: United States v. Ameling, 328 F.3d 443, 448 (8th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted); see also United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 274, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (rejecting “divide and conquer” analysis in which each suspicious observation is considered alone and found susceptible to innocent explanation).
Sentence 59: We conclude that Beck had a reasonable suspicion that Bin-ion was involved in criminal activity and was therefore justified in investigating .him.
Sentence 60: Binion also argues that Beck was not justified in conducting a protective frisk or “pat down.”

Sentence 4: United States v. Ellis, 501 F.3d 958, 961 (8th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).
Sentence 5: The question is an objective one: “whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.”
Sentence 6: Terry, 392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868.
Sentence 7: Whether a frisk was supported by reasonable suspicion is a mixed question of law and fact which we review de novo.
Sentence 8: United States v. Roggeman, 279 F.3d 573, 577 (8th Cir.2002).
Sentence 9: From the facts she had observed, Beck could reasonably have suspected that drugs were being transported in the car.
Sentence 10: Someone in the car had recently been smoking marijuana, and the driver had been apparently trying to hide something under the front seat.
Sentence 11: The driver also had an outstanding warrant for his arrest and had been exceeding the speed limit at 2 a.m.
Sentence 12: An officer’s reasonable belief that someone is involved in drug dealing can support a suspicion that the person is armed since weapons are often present incident to the drug business.
Sentence 13: See United States v. Robinson, 119 F.3d 663, 667 (8th Cir.1997).
Sentence 14: By the time Binion was frisked, he had refused to cooperate by extinguishing his cigarette, see Stachowiak, 521 F.3d at 856-57, and he had reached for his back pocket after he was handcuffed, see Robinson, 119 F.3d at 667 (officer safety in doubt where suspect moved his hands towards his waist and appeared nervous).
Sentence 15: Binion objects that Beck did not mention all of these factors in her police report or testimony, but the objective Terry standard does not require that an officer have verbalized all the reasons “justifying the search articulately, only that such reasons be articulable.”
Sentence 16: Roggeman, 279 F.3d at 583-84.
Sentence 17: Under the circumstances Beck’s suspicion that Binion might be armed was reasonable and the protective frisk therefore justified.
Sentence 18: If an officer detects apparent contraband during a valid protective frisk, the officer may seize the item.
Sentence 19: Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 376-77, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993) (plain feel doctrine); see also Stachowiak, 521 F.3d at 855 (so long as the frisk is supported by an objectively reasonable belief that the suspect was dangerous, the fact that an officer finds drugs rather than a weapon does not require suppression of the drug evidence).
Sentence 20: Beck stated that she immediately suspected that the bulges in Binioris crotch were plastic bags of marijuana, but Binion contends that the bulges did not create probable cause because marijuana “would have been indistinguishable in a tactile sense from [his] genitalia.”
Sentence 21: Whether the bulges that Beck detected created probable cause to seize the contraband is irrelevant because nothing was seized from Binion until after his arrest.
Sentence 22: Binion’s admission to the troopers that he had an ounce of marijuana in his pants created probable cause for his arrest.
Sentence 23: When he arrived at the state patrol headquarters after his arrest, a bag of marijuana fell out of the leg of his pants and was seized as contraband in plain view.
Sentence 24: Two additional bags of drugs were seized when Binion was searched during booking after his arrest.
Sentence 25: See United States v. Davis, 457 F.3d 817, 823 (8th Cir.2006) (allowing use of drug evidence seized at police station after officer detected contraband during frisk, arrested suspect, and searched him incident to arrest).
Sentence 26: None of these seizures relied solely on what Beck felt inside Binioris pants, and we conclude they were all constitutional.
Sentence 27: Binion contends that his detention lasted longer than was necessary because the troopers transported him to headquarters rather than investigating further by the highway.
Sentence 28: While an investigative detention “must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop,” Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983), Binion had been arrested by the time the troopers transported him.
Sentence 29: His detention was then supported by probable cause so the requirement that the detention be minimally intrusive no longer applied.
Sentence 30: Moreover, it appears that the troopers acted diligently because only a half hour elapsed between the traffic stop and when he was taken into custody.
Sentence 31: We conclude that the district court did not err in denying his motion to suppress the physical evidence.
Sentence 32: Binion also moved to suppress the statements he made at the police station, arguing that they were obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination.
Sentence 33: Under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), statements made by a custodial suspect in response to interrogation are inadmissible unless the suspect has voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right against self incrimination.
Sentence 34: The district court found that Binion’s statements were voluntary rather than the result of interrogation and that he had not invoked his right to remain silent.
Sentence 35: We review de novo the legal conclusions underlying the denial of a motion to suppress on Fifth Amendment grounds, while the factual findings are reviewed for clear error.
Sentence 36: United States v. Aldaco, 477 F.3d 1008, 1013 (8th Cir.2007).
Sentence 37: After Binion was searched at headquarters, Sergeant Tim Zych and Special Agent Rodriguez explained his constitutional rights, including those required by Miranda.
Sentence 38: Binion stated that he understood those rights, but he refused to sign a waiver form.
Sentence 39: When he was asked whether he had anything else to say, he responded: “I’m booked, I’ll be back in 10 to 15 [years].
Sentence 40: Did you see what they took off me?”
Sentence 41: Binion argues that these statements are inadmissible because they were made in response to interrogation.
Sentence 42: Interrogation includes both express questioning and “words or actions that officers should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.”
Sentence 43: Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).
Sentence 44: Refusing to sign a written waiver of the privilege against self incrimination does not itself invoke that privilege and does not preclude a subsequent oral waiver.
Sentence 45: See United States v. House, 939 F.2d 659, 662 (8th Cir.1991) (citing North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979)); United States v. Zamarripa, 544 F.2d 978, 981 (8th Cir.1976).
Sentence 46: The troopers did not question Bin-ion about the evidence seized, the potential charges he faced, or any other matter reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.
Sentence 47: See United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, 363 F.3d 788, 795 (8th Cir.2004) (not interrogation to ask a detained person why he had requested to make a phone call).
Sentence 48: Since Binion had been informed of his rights and had neither invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege nor requested an attorney, his decision to volunteer an incriminating response was an intelligent waiver of that right.
Sentence 49: See House, 939 F.2d at 662 (waiver “may be inferred from the fact that the defendant responded to questions posed by the interviewer after being advised of his rights”); Aldaco, 477 F.3d at 1016 (Fifth Amendment does not bar a voluntary statement made by a suspect).
Sentence 50: We conclude that Binion’s statements were voluntary and therefore admissible under the Fifth Amendment and Miranda.
Sentence 51: Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.
Sentence 52: . The Honorable Linda R. Reade, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.', 
Sentence 53: Dissenting/Concuring:  'Not Available',     Dissenting/Concuring 2:  'Not Available',     Dissenting/Concuring 3:  'Not Available'
