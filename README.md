The parameters of the models that were used to prompt the GPT Family Models are described in the paper along with the corresponding reasoning for selecting the same. It should be noted that although we chose parameters to make the model as deterministic as possible, we have no control over the weights used by the GPT Family Models at any particular moment. Practically, the weights could be changed at any moment without our control. Upon replication results may vary.
